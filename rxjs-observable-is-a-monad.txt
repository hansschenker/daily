In functional programming, “monad” is just an interface with two functions. If your type can implement 
those functions in a “reasonable” way (ie following a handful of simple rules), it forms a monad.

Here are the two functions you need to implement, described with TypeScript-like types:

unit, which wraps a normal value in your monad. For Observable, the type would be unit<A>(value: A): Observable<A>. 
We take a value of any type and get a corresponding Observable—presumably one that contains a constant value.
bind, which lets us sequence operations on observables. We take an Observable of some sort and apply a function to it 
which returns another Observable, plumbing them together to get a composite Observable out. 
Here’s the type: bind<A>(input: Observable<A>, f: (x: A): Observable<B>): Observable<B>).

It’s a bit of a mouthful, to be sure. You can think of it like then in JavaScript promises—it plays the same role, 
but the semantics differ slightly¹.
To be a valid monad, a type has to implement these functions with a couple of invariants. I won’t go into the exact laws², 
but they come down to two high-level properties: unit can’t do anything except wrap a value, and bind has to be associative 
(that is, if you have a few binds in a row, it shouldn’t matter which ones are performed first).

Looking through the Observable API (which has surprisingly dense API documentation), 
I see both functions I mentioned but with different names:

unit is implemented as the static method Observable.of, when given a single argument. It takes a value and returns an Observable 
that emits that value and terminates.
bind is implemented as concatMap. This is a method on an Observable object that takes a function, applies it to every value 
in the Observable (giving you an Observable with Observable values in it) and then merges all of them into a single Observable.

The function’s documentation does a good job of describing this operation: concatMap “maps each value to an Observable, 
then flattens all of these inner Observables using concatAll.”
They have a diagram too, which might help. (Or just make things more confusing.)


As an aside, people often decry monads and functional programming as being difficult and complex. 
Then they turn around and claim that things like this are simple and easy to learn:


(A screenshot of the documentation for the defer method, with the following text: “Creates an Observable that, on subscribe, 
calls an Observable factory to make an Observable for each new Observer.”)

Really?

¹ In particular, then in JavaScript promises has two behaviors: if the value returned is a promise, 
it behaves just like bind, but if it’s any other type, it wraps it in a promise first. In practice, 
this means that you can’t use that API to get nested promises which is a real limitation.

² If you don’t mind Haskell notation, there’s a great explanation on Stack Overflow. The difference is that unit 
is called return and bind is written as an infix operator >>=. (So bind(x, f) in my notation would read as x >>= f in Haskell.)

return a >>= k             = k a
m >>= return               = m
xs >>= return . f          = fmap f xs
m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h)    = (m >>= k) >>= h
Here is my attempted explanation:

We expect the return function to wrap a so that its monadic nature is trivial. When we bind it to a function, there are no monadic effects, it should just pass a to the function.

The unwrapped output of m is passed to return that rewraps it. The monadic nature remains the same. So it is the same as the original monad.

The unwrapped value is passed to f then rewrapped. The monadic nature remains the same. This is the behavior expected when we transform a normal function into a monadic function.

I don't have an explanation for this law. This does say that the monad must be "almost associative" though.
