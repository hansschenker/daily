outes rendered in a Router Outlet have access to specific Ionic events that are wired up to animations

Event Name	Trigger
ionViewWillEnter	Fired when the component being routed to is about to animate in.
ionViewDidEnter	Fired when the component being routed to has animated in.
ionViewWillLeave	Fired when the component being routed from is about to animate.
ionViewDidLeave	Fired when the component being routed from has animated.
These event tie into Ionic's animation system and can be used to coordinate parts of your app when a Components is done with it's animation. These events are not a replacement for Angular's own event system, but an addition.

For handling Router Guards, the older ionViewCanEnter and ionViewCanLeave have been replaced with their framework specific equivalent. For Angular, there are Router Guards.
