What is Health
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the 

- absence of disease or infirmity. It is 
- a holistic concept that recognizes the interdependence of different aspects of a person's life 

and encompasses a range of 
  - physical, 
  - mental, and 
  - emotional factors.

- Physical health refers to the functioning of the body's systems, including the heart, lungs, bones, 
  muscles, and immune system. 

- Mental health refers to an individual's emotional and psychological well-being, and includes aspects 
  such as mood, personality, and behavior. 

- Social health refers to an individual's relationships and connections with others, as well as their 
  overall sense of social support and community.

Good health is essential 
- for living a fulfilling life and 
- achieving one's goals and aspirations. 

It is a complex and dynamic state that can be influenced by a range of factors, including 

- genetics, 
- lifestyle, 
- environment, and

- healthy diet, 
- regular physical activity, 
- stress management, and 
- access to quality medical care
