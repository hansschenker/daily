Typescript type vs interface syntax 
------------------------------------

interface
------------
- only for object types
Since interface may only type objects, itâ€™s a perfect match 
for writing object-oriented programs because these programs need many typed objects

type
------------
- can be used to type 
  - objects, 
  - primitives, 
  - and more. As it turns out, 
type is versatile in functional programming style
