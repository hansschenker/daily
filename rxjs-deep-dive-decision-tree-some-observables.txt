Some Observables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I want to receive values only from the Observable that emits a value first
	You want the function race.

I want to be notified when all of them have completed
	You want the function forkJoin.

I want to output the values from either of them
	You want the function merge.

I want to output a value computed from values of the source Observables
	using the latest value of each source whenever any source emits
		You want the function combineLatest.

	using each source value only once
		You want the function zip.

I want to subscribe to each in order
	You want the function concat.
