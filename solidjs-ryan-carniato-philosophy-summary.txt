- State Tree and Component Tree are two separate concerns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- State Tree and Component Tree are two separate concern which should not be coupled
  Problem React: Component Lifecycle and State update are tighly coupled
                 Component rerenders when state changes

Computations not Components
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Components are for code organization not for State management
  components are essential building blocks that allow our programs to be modular

- use functions as building blocks for the framework not classes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - functions are leightweight

  - functions capture closures

  - wrap any reactive computation in a function and rerun that function when its dependencies update

  - automatic rerunning of a function happens whenever the 
    - function gets called in a tracking scope, 
      - such as a JSX expression or 
      - API calls that build "computations" (createEffect, createMemo, etc.).

- functions for state update
  - signal is a getter and setter function with a value
  - computed is deriving state from a signal
  - effect runs when a signal value changes

-  signal is a synchronous computation of a single value,
