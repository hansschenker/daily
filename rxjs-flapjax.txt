Funny enough, GPU data frames came from here. I got a NSF fellowship nominally on parallel/GPU FRP, 
but didn't make sense. Collection-oriented FP easier for speed, hence initial impl of graphistry, 
and then port to RAPIDS as Nvidia collaborators had more $ to invest

initially wanted to simplify events & behaviors idea for .NET / LINQ (read our paper then Your Mouse is a DB). 
Adds ideas like schedulers and hot/cold. RxJS team took new direction w/ lang embedding in ~v5. 
Revisiting in async/await and React era seems useful..

Thanks, kindly. There's a big ecocystem of FRP languages and systems that have all learned from each other.

Also, I finally (finally!) wrote a brief chapter about FRP in my book, PLAI, which you can get from free here:

Thank's for the message! I am a big fan of RxJs and Frp.
Today I stambled upon your talk in Microsoft Research Lab (around 2010) and learned about flapjax. 
I will look into the library and can surley learn from it. Thank's a lot for publishing and wish you happy days in 2023!

I don't know! Of course the Rx folks knew about all the existing FRP efforts. I imagine they were inspired 
by several of them (including all the ones from Haskell), but we were also definitely in conversation at the time…
