CSS transforms, CSS transitions, and CSS animations are three separate CSS specifications.

CSS transitions and animations - change appearance over time
--------------------------------
make things move over time. Transitions and animations 
let you define the transition between two or more states of an element

CSS Transforms - change appearance
------------------------------
Transforms change an element’s appearance through translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing, 
but do not have a time component. You can use the CSS transform property to change the location of an element’s 
coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model, but you need transitions or animation to make that change occur over time.
