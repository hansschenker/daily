No Observable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to create a new Observable
	using custom logic

	using a state machine similar to a for loop

	that throws an error

	that just completes, without emitting values

	that never emits anything

	from an existing source of events

	from a Promise or an event source

	that iterates

	that emits values on a timer

	which is built on demand when subscribed




I want to convert a callback to an Observable
	supporting a conventional callback API

	supporting Node.js callback style API
