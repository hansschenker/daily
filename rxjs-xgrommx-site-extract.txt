The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript unifies both the world of Promises, 
callbacks as well as evented data such as DOM Input, Web Workers, Web Sockets. 
Once we have unified these , this enables rich composition.

Event buses or your typical click events are really an asynchronous event stream, 
on which you can observe and do some side effects. Reactive is that idea on steroids. 
You are able to create data streams of anything, not just from click and hover events. 
Streams are cheap and ubiquitous, anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, 
properties, caches, data structures, etc. For example, imagine your Twitter feed would 
be a data stream in the same fashion that click events are. You can listen to that stream 
and react accordingly.

A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time. It can emit three different things: 
a value (of some type), an error, or a "completed" signal. Consider that the "completed" 
takes place, for instance, when the current window or view containing that button is closed.

We capture these emitted events only asynchronously, by defining a function that will execute 
when a value is emitted, another function when an error is emitted, and another function when 
'completed' is emitted. Sometimes these last two can be omitted and you can just focus on 
defining the function for values. The "listening" to the stream is called subscribing. 
The functions we are defining are observers. The stream is the subject (or "observable") being observed. 
This is precisely the Observer Design Pattern.

Reactive Programming raises the level of abstraction of your code so you can focus on the 
interdependence of events that define the business logic, rather than having to constantly 
fiddle with a large amount of implementation details. Code in RP will likely be more concise.

The benefit is more evident in modern webapps and mobile apps that are highly interactive with a 
multitude of UI events related to data events. 10 years ago, interaction with web pages was basically 
about submitting a long form to the backend and performing simple rendering to the frontend. 
Apps have evolved to be more real-time: modifying a single form field can automatically trigger a 
save to the backend, "likes" to some content can be reflected in real time to other connected users, 
and so forth.

Apps nowadays have an abundancy of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive 
experience to the user. We need tools for properly dealing with that, and Reactive Programming is an answer.

Thinking in RP, with examples
Let's dive into the real stuff. A real-world example with a step-by-step guide on how to think in RP.
 No synthetic examples, no half-explained . By the end of this tutorial we will have produced 
real functioning code, while knowing why we did each thing.

I picked JavaScript and RxJS as the tools for this, for a reason: JavaScript is the most familiar 
language out there at the moment, and the Rx* library family is widely available for many languages 
and platforms (.NET, Java, Scala, Clojure, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, C++, Objective-C/Cocoa, Groovy, etc). 
So whatever your tools are, you can concretely benefit by following this tutorial.

RxJs Contract
--------------------

The RxJS Contract
Assume the RxJS Grammar
Messages sent to instances of the Observer object follow the following grammar: 
onNext* (onCompleted | onError)?

This grammar allows observable sequences to send any amount (0 or more) of onNext messages to 
the subscribed observer instance, optionally followed by a single success (onCompleted) or failure 
(onError) message.

The single message indicating that an observable sequence has finished ensures that consumers of 
the observable sequence can deterministically establish that it is safe to perform cleanup operations.

A single failure further ensures that abort semantics can be maintained for operators that work on 
multiple observable sequences.


What are the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)?
---------------------------------------------------------
The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a library for composing asynchronous 
and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators. 
Using RxJS, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous 
data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams 
using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers.

Whether you are authoring a web-based application or server-side applications with Node.js, you have 
to deal with asynchronous and event-based programming constantly. Web applications and Node.js 
applications have I/O operations and computationally expensive tasks that might take a long time 
to complete and potentially block the main thread. Furthermore, handling exceptions, cancellation, 
and synchronization is difficult and error-prone.

Using RxJS, you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams (that come from diverse sources, 
e.g., stock quote, tweets, computer events, web service requests, etc.), and subscribe to the 
event stream using the Observer object. The Observable object notifies the subscribed Observer object 
whenever an event occurs.

Because observable sequences are data streams, you can query them using standard query operators 
implemented by the Observable extension methods. Thus you can filter, project, aggregate, 
compose and perform time-based operations on multiple events easily by using these standard query operators.
 In addition, there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries 
to be written. Cancellation, exceptions, and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using 
the extension methods provided by Rx.

RxJS complements and interoperates smoothly with both synchronous data streams such as Arrays, 
Sets and Maps and single-value asynchronous computations such as Promises as the following diagram shows:

Single return value	Mutiple return values
Pull/Synchronous/Interactive	Object	Iterables (Array | Set | Map | Object)
Push/Asynchronous/Reactive	Promise	Observable
Pushing vs. Pulling Data

In interactive programming, the application actively polls a data source for more information by 
retrieving data from a sequence that represents the source. Such behavior is represented by the 
iterator pattern of JavaScript Arrays, Objects, Sets, Maps, etc. In interactive programming, one 
must get the next item by either getting an item by an index in an Array, or through ES6 iterators.

The application is active in the data retrieval process: it decides about the pace of the retrieval 
by calling next at its own convenience. This enumeration pattern is synchronous, which means your 
application might be blocked while polling the data source. Such pulling pattern is similar to visiting 
your library and checking out a book. After you are done with the book, you pay another visit to check
 out another one.

On the other hand, in reactive programming, the application is offered more information by subscribing 
to a data stream (called observable sequence in RxJS), and any update is handed to it from the source. 
The application is passive in the data retrieval process: apart from subscribing to the observable source, 
it does not actively poll the source, but merely react to the data being pushed to it. When the event 
has completed, the source will send a notice to the subscriber. In this way, your application will not 
be blocked by waiting for the source to update. This is the push pattern employed by Reactive Extensions 
for JavaScript. This is similar to joining a book club in which you register your interest in a 
particular genre, and books that match your interest are automatically sent to you as they are published.
 You do not need to stand in a line to acquire something that you want. Employing a push pattern is 
especially helpful in heavy UI environment in which the UI thread cannot be blocked while the application 
is waiting for some events, which is essential in JavaScript environments which has its own set of 
asynchronous requirements. In summary, by using RxJS, you can make your application more responsive.

The push model implemented by Rx is represented by the observable pattern of Observable/Observer. 
The Observable will notify all the observers automatically of any state changes. To register an interest
 through a subscription, you use the subscribe method of Observable, which takes on an Observer and 
returns a Disposable object. This gives you the ability to track your subscription and be able to 
dispose the subscription. You can essentially treat the observable sequence (such as a sequence of
 mouseover events) as if it were a normal collection. RxJS�s built-in query implementation over 
bservable sequences allows developers to compose complex event processing queries over push-based 
sequences such as events, callbacks, Promises, HTML5 Geolocation APIs, and much much more.. For more
 information on these two interfaces, see Exploring The Major  in RxJS.

This topic describes the major Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (Rx) objects used to represent 
observable sequences and subscribe to them.

The Observable / Observer objects are available in the core distribution of RxJS.

Observable / Observer
Rx exposes asynchronous and event-based data sources as push-based, observable sequences abstracted 
by the Observable object in the core distribution of RxJS. It represents a data source that can be 
observed, meaning that it can send data to anyone who is interested.

As described in What is RxJS, the other half of the push model is represented by the Observer object, 
which represents an observer who registers an interest through a subscription. Items are subsequently 
handed to the observer from the observable sequence to which it subscribes.

In order to receive notifications from an observable collection, you use the subscribe method of 
Observable to hand it an Observer object. In return for this observer, the subscribe method returns a 
Disposable object that acts as a handle for the subscription. This allows you to clean up the subscription
 after you are done. Calling dispose on this object detaches the observer from the source so that 
notifications are no longer delivered. As you can infer, in RxJS you do not need to explicitly unsubscribe
 from an event as in the common JavaScript event model.

Observers support three publication events, reflected by the object's methods. The onNext can be 
called zero or more times, when the observable data source has data available. For example, an 
observable data source used for mouse move events can send out an event object every time the mouse 
has moved. The other two methods are used to indicate completion or errors.

The following lists the Observable / Observer objects in addition to the Disposable object.

Creating and Subscribing to Simple Observable Sequences
-----------------------------------------------------------

You do not need to implement the Observable class manually to create an observable sequence. 
Similarly, you do not need to implement Observer either to subscribe to a sequence. 

By installing the Reactive Extension libraries, you can take advantage of 
- the Observable type which provides many operators for you 
  to create a simple sequence with zero, one or more elements. 

In addition, RxJS provides an overloaded subscribe method which allows you to pass in 
- onNext, 
- onError and 
- onCompleted function handlers.

When an observer subscribes to an observable sequence, the subscribe method may be using asynchronous 
behavior behind the scenes depending on the operator. Therefore, the subscribe call is asynchronous in 
that the caller is not blocked until the observation of the sequence completes. This will be covered in
 more details in the Using Schedulers topic.

Notice that the subscribe method returns a Disposable, so that you can unsubscribe to a sequence and 
dispose of it easily. When you invoke the dispose method on the observable sequence, the observer will 
stop listening to the observable for data. Normally, you do not need to explicitly call dispose unless 
you need to unsubscribe early, or when the source observable sequence has a longer life span than the 
observer. Subscriptions in Rx are designed for fire-and-forget scenarios without the usage of a finalizer.
 Note that the default behavior of the Observable operators is to dispose of the subscription as soon as
 possible (i.e, when an onCompleted or onError messages is published). For example, the code will 
subscribe x to both sequences a and b. If a throws an error, x will immediately be unsubscribed from b.

var x = Rx.Observable.zip(a, b, (a1, b1) => a1 + b1).subscribe();

for functional reactive programming.

Bridging to Events
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 programming.
Bridging to Events
RxJS provides factory methods for you to bridge with existing asynchronous sources in the DOM or Node.js 
so that you can employ the rich composing, filtering and resource management features provided by RxJS 
on any kind of data streams. This topic examines the fromEvent and fromEventPattern operator that allows
 "importing" a DOM or custom event into RxJS as an observable sequence. Every time an event is raised, 
an onNext message will be delivered to the observable sequence. You can then manipulate event data just 
like any other observable sequences.

RxJS does not aim at replacing existing asynchronous programming models such as promises or callbacks. 
However, when you attempt to compose events, RxJS’s factory methods will provide you the convenience 
that cannot be found in the current programming model. This is especially true for resource maintenance
 (e.g., when to unsubscribe) and filtering (e.g., choosing what kind of data to receive). In this topic 
and the ones that follow, you can examine how these RxJS features can assist you in asynchronous programming.

Natively, RxJS supports a number of libraries and hooks into them such as jQuery, Zepto.js, AngularJS, 
Ember.js and Backbone.js for using their event system. This behavior, however, can be overridden to only 
use native bindings only. By default, RxJS also has hooks for Node.js EventEmitter events natively supported.

Converting a DOM event to a RxJS Observable Sequence
The following sample creates a simple DOM event handler for the mouse move event, and prints out the 
mouse’s location on the page.

var result = document.getElementById('result');

document.addEventListener('mousemove', e => result.innerHTML = e.clientX + ', ' + e.clientY, false);
To import an event into RxJS, you can use the fromEvent operator, and provide the event arguments that 
will be raised by the event being bridged. It then converts the given event into an observable sequence.

In the following example, we convert the mousemove event stream of the DOM into an observable sequence. 
Every time a mouse-move event is fired, the subscriber will receive an onNext notification. We can then 
examine the event arguments value of such notification and get the location of the mouse-move.

var result = document.getElementById('result');

var source = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');

var subscription = source.subscribe(e => result.innerHTML = e.clientX + ', ' + e.clientY);
Notice that in this sample, move becomes an observable sequence in which we can manipulate further. 
The Querying Observable Sequences topic will show you how you can project this sequence into a collection 
of Points type and filter its content, so that your application will only receive values that satisfy a 
certain criteria.

Bridging to Callbacks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gramming.
Bridging to Callbacks
Besides events, other asynchronous data sources exist in the the web and server-side world. One of them 
is the the simple callback pattern which is frequently used in Node.js. In this design pattern, the arguments 
are passed to the function, and then a callback is usually the last parameter, which when executed, passes 
control to the inner scope with the data. Node.js has a standard way of doing callbacks in which the the 
callback is called with the Error object first if there is an error, else null, and then the additional 
parameters from the callback.

Converting Callbacks to Observable Sequences
Many asynchronous methods in Node.js and the many JavaScript APIs are written in such a way that it has 
a callback as the last parameter. These standard callbacks are executed with the data passed to it once 
it is available. We can use the Rx.Observable.fromCallback to wrap these kinds of callbacks. Note that 
this does not cover the Node.js style of callbacks where the Error parameter is first. For that operation, 
we provide the Rx.Observable.fromNodeCallback which we will cover below.

In the following example, we will convert the Node.js fs.exists function. This function takes a path and 
returns a true or false value whether the file exists, in this case we will check if 'file.txt' exists. 
The arguments returned when wrapped in Rx.Observable.fromCallback will return an array containing the 
arguments passed to the callback.

var Rx = require('rx'),
    fs = require('fs');

// Wrap the exists method
var exists = Rx.Observable.fromCallback(fs.exists);

var source = exists('file.txt');

// Get the first argument only which is true/false
var subscription = source.subscribe(
    x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
    e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
    () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: true
// => onCompleted
Converting Node.js Style Callbacks to Observable Sequences
Node.js has adopted a convention in many of the callbacks where an error may occur, such as File I/O, 
Network requests, etc. RxJS supports this through the Rx.Observable.fromNodeCallback method in which 
the error, if present, is captured and the onError notification is sent. Otherwise, the onNext is sent 
with the rest of the callback arguments, followed by an onCompleted notification.

In the following example, we will convert the Node.js fs.rename function to an Observable sequence.

var fs = require('fs'),
    Rx = require('rx');

// Wrap fs.rename
var rename = Rx.Observable.fromNodeCallback(fs.rename);

// Rename file which returns no parameters except an error
var source = rename('file1.txt', 'file2.txt');

var subscription = source.subscribe(
    x => console.log('onNext: success!'),
    e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
    () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: success!
// => onCompleted
Converting Observable sequences to Callbacks
We can easily go in another direction and convert an observable sequence to a callback. This of course 
requires the observable sequence to yield only one value for this to make sense. Let's convert using the 
timer method to wait for a certain amount of time. The implementation of toCallback could look like the 
following. Note that it is not included in RxJS but you can easily add it if needed.

Rx.Observable.prototype.toCallback = cb => {
  var source = this;
  return () => {
    var val, hasVal = false;
    source.subscribe(
      x=> { hasVal = true; val = x; },
      e => throw e, // Default error handling
      () => hasVal && cb(val)}
    );
  };
};
Then we could execute our command simply like the following:

function cb (x) { console.log('hi!'); }

setTimeout(
  Rx.Observable.timer(5000)
    .toCallback(cb)
  , 500);
Converting Observable sequences to Node.js Style Callbacks
The same could also apply to Node.js style callbacks should you desire that behavior. Once again the same 
restrictions apply with regards to having a single value and an end much like above. The implementation of 
toNodeCallback could look like the following. Note that it is not included in RxJS but you can easily add 
it if needed.

Rx.Observable.prototype.toNodeCallback = cb => {
  var source = this;
  return () => {
    var val, hasVal = false;
    source.subscribe(
      x => { hasVal = true; val = x; },
      e => cb(e),
      () => hasVal && cb(null, val)}
    );
  };
};
We could then take this and for example if we had an observable sequence which gets a value from a REST 
call and then convert it to Node.js style.

getData().toNodeCallback((err, data) => {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    // Do something with the data
});

RxJS - Javascript library for functional reactive programming.
Bridging to Promises
Promises are a defacto standard within JavaScript community and is part of the ECMAScript Standard. 
A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interacting 
with a promise is through its then method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual 
value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled. You can create them very easily where the 
constructor has two functions, resolve and reject which resolves the value or rejects it for a given 
reason. RxJS is fully committed to standards and has native support for Promises for any number of methods 
where they can be used interchangeably with Observable sequences.

The advantage that you get when you intermix Promises with Observable sequences is that unlike the ES6
 Promise standard, you get cancellation semantics which means you can disregard values if you no longer 
are interested. One of the biggest problems around Promises right now are around cancellation, as to 
cancel the operation, such as an XHR is not easily done with the existing standard, nor is it to only 
get the last value to ensure no out of order requests. With Observable sequences, you get that behavior 
for free in a multicast behavior, instead of the unicast Promise behavior.

The following list of operators natively support Promises:

Rx.Observable.amb | Rx.Observable.prototype.amb
Rx.Observable.case
Rx.Observable.catch | Rx.Observable.prototype.catch
Rx.Observable.combineLatest | Rx.Observable.prototype.combineLatest
Rx.Observable.concat | Rx.Observable.prototype.concat
Rx.Observable.prototype.concatMap
Rx.Observable.prototype.concatMapObserver
Rx.Observable.defer
Rx.Observable.prototype.flatMap
Rx.Observable.prototype.flatMapLatest
Rx.Observable.forkJoin | Rx.Observable.prototype.forkJoin
Rx.Observable.if
Rx.Observable.merge
Rx.Observable.prototype.mergeAll
Rx.Observable.onErrorResumeNext | Rx.Observable.prototype.onErrorResumeNext
Rx.Observable.prototype.selectMany
Rx.Observable.prototype.selectSwitch
Rx.Observable.prototype.sequenceEqual
Rx.Observable.prototype.skipUntil
Rx.Observable.startAsync
Rx.Observable.prototype.switch
Rx.Observable.prototype.takeUntil
Rx.Observable.prototype.debounceWithSelector
Rx.Observable.prototype.timeoutWithSelector
Rx.Observable.while
Rx.Observable.prototype.window
Rx.Observable.withLatestFrom
Rx.Observable.zip | Rx.Observable.prototype.zip
Because of this, we can now do a number of very interesting things such as combining Promises and 
Observable sequences.

var source = Rx.Observable.range(0, 3)
  .flatMap(x => Promise.resolve(x * x));

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: 0
// => onNext: 1
// => onNext: 4
// => onCompleted
This is just scratching the surface of what Promises and RxJS can do together so that we have first 
class single values and first class multiple values working together.

Converting Promises to Observable Sequences
It's quite simple to convert a Promise object which conforms to the ES6 Standard Promise where the 
behavior is uniform across implementations. To support this, we provide the Rx.Observable.fromPromise 
method which calls the then method of the promise to handle both success and error cases.

In the following example, we create promise objects using RSVP library.

// Create a promise which resolves 42
var promise1 = new RSVP.Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve(42));

var source1 = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(promise1);

var subscription1 = source1.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: 42
// => onCompleted

// Create a promise which rejects with an error
var promise2 = new RSVP.Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('reason')));

var source2 = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(promise2);

var subscription2 = source2.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onError: reason
Notice that in this sample, these promises become observable sequences which we can manipulate further. 
The Querying Observable Sequences topic will show you how you can project this sequence into another, 
filter its content, so that your application will only receive values that satisfy a certain criteria.

Converting Observable Sequences to Promises
Just as you can convert a Promise to an Observable sequence, you can also convert an Observable sequence 
to a Promise. This either requires native support for Promises, or a Promise library you can add yourself, 
such as Q, RSVP, when.js among others. These libraries must conform to the ES6 standard for construction 
where it provides two functions to resolve or reject the promise.

var p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve(42));
We can use the toPromise method which allows you to convert an Observable sequence to a Promise. This 
method accepts a Promise constructor, and if not provided, will default to a default implementation. 
In this first example, we will use RSVP to construct our Promise objects.

// Return a single value
var source1 = Rx.Observable.just(1).toPromise(RSVP.Promise);

source1.then(
  value => console.log('Resolved value: %s', value),
  reason => console.log('Rejected reason: %s', reason));

// => Resolved value: 1

// Reject the Promise
var source2 = Rx.Observable.throwError(new Error('reason')).toPromise(RSVP.Promise);

source2.then(
  value => console.log('Resolved value: %s', value),
  reason => console.log('Rejected reason: %s', reason));

// => Rejected reason: Error: reason
If an implementation is not given with the toPromise method, it will fall back to the Promise 
implementation specified in the Rx.config.Promise field. By default this will be set to the runtime's 
ES6 Promise implementation, but can easily be overridden by specifying the configuration information.

Rx.config.Promise = RSVP.Promise;

var source1 = Rx.Observable.just(1).toPromise();

source1.then(
  value => console.log('Resolved value: %s', value),
  reason => console.log('Rejected reason: %s', reason));

// => Resolved value: 1
If you are in a pure ES6 environment, this should just work without any settings on your part as it will
 use the runtime's ES6 Promise implementation.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.just(1).toPromise();

source1.then(
  value => console.log('Resolved value: %s', value),
  reason => console.log('Rejected reason: %s', reason));

Bridging to Generators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 EDIT THIS PAGE

RxJS - Javascript library for functional reactive programming.
Generators and Observable Sequences
One of the more exciting features of ES6 is a new function type called generators. They have been in 
Firefox for years, although they have now been finally standardized in ES6, and will be shipping in a 
browser or runtime near you. How generators differ from normal functions is that a normal function such 
as the following will run to completion, regardless of whether it is asynchronous or not.

function printNumberOfTimes(msg, n) {
  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(msg);
  }
}

printNumberOfTime('Hello world', 1);
// => Hello world

// Asynchronous
setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello from setTimeout after one second'), 1000); 
// => Hello from setTimeout after one second
Instead of running to completion, generators allow us to interrupt the flow of the function by 
introducing the yield keyword which pauses the function. The function cannot resume on its own without 
the external consumer saying that they need the next value.

To create a generator function, you must use the function* syntax which then becomes a generator. In this 
particular example, we will yield a single value, the meaning of life.

function* theMeaningOfLife() {
  yield 42;
}
To get the value out, we need to invoke the function, and then call next to get the next value. 
The return value from the next call will have a flag as to whether it is done, as well as any value 
that is yielded. Note that the function doesn't do anything until we start to call next.

var it = theMeaningOfLife();

it.next();
// => { done: false, value: 42 }

it.next();
// => { done: true, value: undefined }
We can also use some ES6 shorthand for getting values from a generator such as the for..of.

for (var v of theMeaningOfLife()) {
  console.log(v);
}
// => 42
This of course is only scratching the surface of what generators are capable of doing as we're more 
focused on the simple nature of yielding values.

Since RxJS believes heavily in standards, we also look for ways to incorporate new language features as 
they become standardized so that you can take advantage of them, combined with the power of RxJS.

Async/Await Style and RxJS
One common complaint of JavaScript is the callback nature to asynchronous behavior. Luckily, this can 
be solved quite easily with a library approach. To that end, we introduce Rx.Observable.spawn which 
allows you to write code in a straight forward manner and can yield not only Observable sequences, but 
also Promises, Callbacks, Arrays, etc. This allows you to write your code in a very imperative manner 
without all the callbacks, but also brings the power of RxJS whether you want to call timeout, retry, 
catch or any other method for that matter. Note that this only yields a single value, but in RxJS terms, 
this is still quite useful.

For example, we could get the HTML from Bing.com and write it to the console, with a timeout of 5 seconds 
which will throw an error should it not respond in time. We could also add in things like retry and catch 
so that we could for example try three times and then if it fails, give a default response or cached version.

var Rx = require('rx');
var request = require('request');
var get = Rx.Observable.fromNodeCallback(request);

Rx.Observable.spawn(function* () {
  var data;
  try {
    data = yield get('http://bing.com').timeout(5000 /*ms*/);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Error %s', e);
  } 

  console.log(data);
}).subscribe();
Mixing Operators with Generators
Many of the operators inside RxJS also support generators. For example, we could use the Rx.Observable.
from method to take a generator function, in this case, a Fibonacci sequence, take 10 of them and display it.

function* fibonacci(){
  var fn1 = 1;
  var fn2 = 1;
  while (1) {
    var current = fn2;
    fn2 = fn1;
    fn1 = fn1 + current;
    yield current;
  }
}

Rx.Observable.from(fibonacci())
  .take(10)
  .subscribe(x => console.log('Value: %s', x));

//=> Value: 1
//=> Value: 1
//=> Value: 2
//=> Value: 3
//=> Value: 5
//=> Value: 8
//=> Value: 13
//=> Value: 21
//=> Value: 34
//=> Value: 55
That's just the beginning, as there are several operators such as concatMap/selectConcat and 
flatMap/selectMany which take iterables as an argument so that we can further enable composition. 
For example, we could project using generators from a flatMap operation.

var source = Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3)
  .flatMap(
    (x, i) => function* () { yield x; yield i; }(),
    (x, y, i1, i2) => x + y + i1 + i2
  );

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => Next: 2
// => Next: 2
// => Next: 5
// => Next: 5
// => Next: 8
// => Next: 8
// => Completed
The future of JavaScript is exciting and generators add new possibilities to our applications to allow 
them to mix and match our programming styles.

Notice that in this sample, move becomes an observable sequence in which we can manipulate further. 
The Querying Observable Sequences topic will show you how you can project this sequence into a collection 
of Points type and filter its content, so that your application will only receive values that satisfy a
 certain criteria.

Querying Observable Sequences
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Querying Observable Sequences
In Bridging to Events, we have converted existing DOM and Node.js events into observable sequences to 
subscribe to them. In this topic, we will look at the first-class nature of observable sequences as 
IObservable objects, in which generic LINQ operators are supplied by the Rx assemblies to manipulate 
these objects. Most operators take an observable sequence and perform some logic on it and output another 
observable sequence. In addition, as you can see from our code samples, you can even chain multiple 
operators on a source sequence to tweak the resulting sequence to your exact requirement.

Using Different Operators
We have already used the create and range operators in previous topics to create and return simple sequences. 
We have also used the fromEvent and fromEventPattern operators to convert existing events into observable 
sequences. In this topic, we will use other operators of the Observable type so that you can filter, 
group and transform data. Such operators take observable sequence(s) as input, and produce observable 
sequence(s) as output.

Combining different sequences
In this section, we will examine some of the operators that combine various observable sequences into 
a single observable sequence. Notice that data is not transformed when we combine sequences. In the 
following sample, we use the Concat operator to combine two sequences into a single sequence and subscribe 
to it. For illustration purpose, we will use the very simple range(x, y) operator to create a sequence of 
integers that starts with x and produces y sequential numbers afterwards.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);
var source2 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);

source1.concat(source2)
   .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
Notice that the resultant sequence is 1,2,3,1,2,3. This is because when you use the concat operator, 
the 2nd sequence (source2) will not be active until after the 1st sequence (source1) has finished 
pushing all its values. It is only after source1 has completed, then source2 will start to push values 
to the resultant sequence. The subscriber will then get all the values from the resultant sequence.

Compare this with the merge operator. If you run the following sample code, you will get 1,1,2,2,3,3. 
This is because the two sequences are active at the same time and values are pushed out as they occur 
in the sources. The resultant sequence only completes when the last source sequence has finished 
pushing values.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);
var source2 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);

source1.merge(source2)
   .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 1
// => 1
// => 2
// => 2
// => 3
// => 3
Another comparison can be done with the catch operator. In this case, if source1 completes without 
any error, then source2 will not start. Therefore, if you run the following sample code, you will 
get 1,2,3 only since source2 (which produces 4,5,6) is ignored.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);
var source2 = Rx.Observable.range(4, 3);

source1.catch(source2)
   .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
Finally, let’s look at onErrorResumeNext. This operator will move on to source2 even if source1 cannot 
be completed due to an error. In the following example, even though source1 represents a sequence that 
terminates with an exception by using the throw operator, the subscriber will receive values (1,2,3) 
published by source2. Therefore, if you expect either source sequence to produce any error, it is a 
safer bet to use onErrorResumeNext to guarantee that the subscriber will still receive some values.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.throw(new Error('An error has occurred.'));
var source2 = Rx.Observable.range(1, 3);

source1.onErrorResumeNext(source2)
   .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
Projection
The select or map operator can translate each element of an observable sequence into another form.

In the following example, we project a sequence of strings into a series of integers representing the
 length.

var array = ['Reactive', 'Extensions', 'RxJS'];

var seqString = Rx.Observable.from(array);

var seqNum = seqString.map(x => x.length);

seqNum
   .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 8
// => 10
// => 4
In the following sample, which is an extension of the event conversion example we saw in the Bridging 
with Existing Events topic, we use the select or map operator to project the event arguments to a point 
of x and y. This way, we are transforming a mouse move event sequence into a data type that can be parsed 
and manipulated further, as can be seen in the next "Filtering" section.

var move = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');

var points = move.map(e => ({x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }));

points.subscribe(
    pos => console.log('Mouse at point ' + pos.x + ', ' + pos.y));
Finally, let’s look at the selectMany or flatMap operator. The selectMany or flatMap operator has many 
overloads, one of which takes a selector function argument. This selector function is invoked on every 
value pushed out by the source observable. For each of these values, the selector projects it into a 
mini observable sequence. At the end, the selectMany or flatMap operator flattens all of these mini 
sequences into a single resultant sequence, which is then pushed to the subscriber.

The observable returned from selectMany or flatMap publishes onCompleted after the source sequence and 
all mini observable sequences produced by the selector have completed. It fires onError when an error 
has occurred in the source stream, when an exception was thrown by the selector function, or when an 
error occurred in any of the mini observable sequences.

In the following example, we first create a source sequence which produces an integer every 5 seconds, 
and decide to just take the first 2 values produced (by using the take operator). We then use selectMany 
or flatMap to project each of these integers using another sequence of {100, 101, 102}. By doing so, 
two mini observable sequences are produced, {100, 101, 102} and {100, 101, 102}. These are finally 
flattened into a single stream of integers of {100, 101, 102, 100, 101, 102} and pushed to the observer.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.interval(5000).take(2);
var proj = Rx.Observable.range(100, 3);
var resultSeq = source1.flatMap(proj);

var subscription = resultSeq.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e.message),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: 100
// => onNext: 101
// => onNext: 102
// => onNext: 100
// => onNext: 101
// => onNext: 102
// => onCompleted
Filtering
In the following example, we use the generate operator to create a simple observable sequence of numbers. 
The generate operator has several versions including with relative and absolute time scheduling. In our 
example, it takes an initial state (0 in our example), a conditional function to terminate 
(fewer than 10 times), an iterator (+1), a result selector (a square function of the current value), 
and prints out only those smaller than 5 using the filter or where operators.

var seq = Rx.Observable.generate(
    0,
    i => i < 10,
    i => i + 1,
    i => i * i);

var source = seq.filter(n => n < 5);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e.message),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => onNext: 0
// => onNext: 1
// => onNext: 4
// => onCompleted
The following example is an extension of the projection example you have seen earlier in this topic. 
In that sample, we have used the select or map operator to project the event arguments into a point 
with x and y. In the following example, we use the filter or where and select or map operators to
 pick only those mouse movements that we are interested in. In this case, we filter the mouse moves 
to those over the first bisector (where the x and y coordinates are equal).

var move = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');

var points = move.map(e => ({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }));

var overfirstbisector = points.filter(pos => pos.x === pos.y);

var movesub = overfirstbisector.subscribe(pos => console.log('mouse at ' + pos.x + ', ' pos.y));
Time-based Operation
You can use the Buffer operators to perform time-based operations.

Buffering an observable sequence means that an observable sequence’s values are put into a buffer 
based on either a specified timespan or by a count threshold. This is especially helpful in situations
when you expect a tremendous amount of data to be pushed out by the sequence, and the subscriber does 
not have the resource to process these values. By buffering the results based on time or count, and 
only returning a sequence of values when the criteria is exceeded (or when the source sequence has completed),
 the subscriber can process OnNext calls at its own pace.

In the following example, we first create a simple sequence of integers for every second. We then use 
the bufferWithCount operator and specify that each buffer will hold 5 items from the sequence. 
The onNext is called when the buffer is full. We then tally the sum of the buffer using Array.reduce. 
The buffer is automatically flushed and another cycle begins. The printout will be 10, 35, 60… 
in which 10=0+1+2+3+4, 35=5+6+7+8+9, and so on.

var seq = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);

var bufSeq = seq.bufferWithCount(5);

bufSeq
    .map(arr => arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0))
    .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));

// => 10
// => 35
// => 60
...
We can also create a buffer with a specified time span in milliseconds. In the following example, 
the buffer will hold items that have accumulated for 3 seconds. The printout will be 3, 12, 21… in 
which 3=0+1+2, 12=3+4+5, and so on.

var seq = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);

var bufSeq = seq.bufferWithTime(3000);

bufSeq
    .map(arr => arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0))
    .subscribe(console.log.bind(console));
Note that if you are using any of the buffer* or window* operators, you have to make sure that the 
sequence is not empty before filtering on it.

Operators by Categories
The Operators by Categories topic lists all of the major operators implemented by the Observable type 
by their categories; specifically: creation, conversion, combine, functional, mathematical, time, 
exceptions, miscellaneous, selection and primitives.

Error Handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 EDIT THIS PAGE

RxJS - Javascript library for functional reactive programming.
Error Handling in the Reactive Extensions
One of the most difficult tasks in asynchronous programming is dealing with errors. Unlike interactive 
style programming, we cannot simply use the try/catch/finally approach that we use when dealing with 
blocking code.

try {
  for (var obj in objs) {
    doSomething(obj);
  }
} catch (e) {
  handleError(e);
} finally {
  doCleanup();
}
These actions mirror exactly our Observer class which has the following contract for handing zero to 
infinite items with onNext and optionally handling either an Error with onError or successful completion 
with onCompleted.

interface Observer<T> {
  onNext(value: T) : void
  onError(error: Error) : void
  onCompleted() : void
}
But the try/catch/finally approach won't work with asynchronous code. Instead, we have a myriad of 
ways of handling errors as they occur, and ensure proper disposal of resources.

For example, we might want to do the following:

swallow the error and switch over to a backup Observable to continue the sequence
swallow the error and emit a default item
swallow the error and immediately try to restart the failed Observable
swallow the error and try to restart the failed Observable after some back-off interval
We'll cover each of those scenarios and more in this section.

Catching Errors
The first topic is catching errors as they happen with our streams. In the Reactive Extensions, 
any error is propogated through the onError channel which halts the sequence. We can compensate 
for this by using the catch operator, at both the class and instance level.

Using the class level catch method, we can catch errors as they happen with the current sequence 
and then move to the next sequence should there be an error. For example, we could try getting data 
from several URLs, it doesn't matter which since they all have the same data, and then if that fails, 
default to a cached version, so an error should never propagate. One thing to note is that if get('url') 
calls succeed, then it will not move onto the next sequence in the list.

var source = Rx.Observable.catch(
  get('url1'),
  get('url2'),
  get('url3'),
  getCachedVersion()
);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Display the data as it comes in
  }
);
We also have an instance version of catch which can be used two ways. The first way is much like the 
example above, where we can take an existing stream, catch the error and move onto the next stream or 
Promise.

var source = get('url1').catch(getCachedVersion());

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Display the data as it comes in
  }
);
The other overload of catch allows us to inspect the error as it comes in so we can decide which route 
to take. For example, if an error status code of 500 comes back from our web server, we can assume it 
is down and then use a cached version.

var source = get('url1').catch(e => {
  if (e.status === 500) {
    return cachedVersion();
  } else {
    return get('url2');
  }
});

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Display the data as it comes in
  }
);
This isn't the only way to handle errors as there are plenty of others as you'll see below.

Ignoring Errors with onErrorResumeNext
The Reactive Extensions borrowed from a number of languages in our design. One of those features is 
bringing On Error Resume Next from Microsoft Visual Basic. This operation specifies that when a run-time 
error occurs, control goes to the statement immediately following the statement where the error occurred, 
and execution continues from that point. There are some instances with stream processing that you simply 
want to skip a stream which produces an error and move to the next stream. We can achieve this with a 
class based and instance based onErrorResumeNext method.

The class based onErrorResumeNext continues a stream that is terminated normally or by an Error with the 
next stream or Promise. Unlike catch, onErrorResumeNext will continue to the next sequence regardless of 
whether the previous was in error or not. To make this more concrete, let's use a simple example of 
mixing error sequences with normal sequences.

var source = Rx.Observable.onErrorResumeNext(
  Rx.Observable.just(42),
  Rx.Observable.throw(new Error()),
  Rx.Observable.just(56),
  Rx.Observable.throw(new Error()),
  Rx.Observable.just(78)
);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => console.log(data)
);
// => 42
// => 56
// => 78
The instance based onErrorResumeNext is similar to the class based version, the only difference being 
that it is attached to the prototype, but can take another sequence or Promise and continue.

Retrying Sequences
When catching errors isn't enough and we want to retry our logic, we can do so with retry or retryWhen 
operators. With the retry operator, we can try a certain operation a number of times before an error is 
thrown. This is useful when you need to get data from a resource which may have intermittent failures 
due to load or any other issue.

Let's take a look at a simple example of trying to get some data from a URL and giving up after three 
tries.

// Try three times to get the data and then give up
var source = get('url').retry(3);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => console.log(data),
  err => console.log(err)
);
In the above example, it will give up after three tries and thus call onError if it continues to fail 
after the third try. We can remedy that by adding catch to use an alternate source.

// Try three times to get the data and then return cached data if still fails
var source = get('url').retry(3).catch(cachedVersion());

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Displays the data from the URL or cached data
    console.log(data);
  }
);
The above case retries immediately upon failure. But what if you want to control when a retry happens? 
We have the retryWhen operator which allows us to deeply control when the next try happens.
We incrementally back off trying again by using the following method:

var source = get('url').retryWhen(
   attempts =>
    attempts
      .zip(Observable.range(1, 3), (_, i) => i)
      .flatMap(i => {
        console.log('delay retry by ' + i + ' second(s)');
        return Rx.Observable.timer(i * 1000);
      });
);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Displays the data from the URL or cached data
    console.log(data);
  }
);
// => delay retry by 1 second(s)
// => delay retry by 2 second(s)
// => Data
Ensuring Cleanup with Finally
We've already covered the try/catch part of try/catch/finally, so what about finally? We have the 
finally operator which calls a function after the source sequence terminates gracefully or exceptionally. 
This is useful if you are using external resources or need to free up a particular variable upon completion.

In this example, we can ensure that our WebSocket will indeed be closed once the last message is processed.

var socket = new WebSocket('ws://someurl', 'xmpp');

var source = Rx.Observable.from(data)
  .finally(() => socket.close());

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    socket.send(data);
  }
);
But we can do a better job in terms of managing resources if need be by using the using method.

Ensuring Resource Disposal
As stated above, finally can be used to ensure proper cleanup of any resources or perform any side 
effects as necessary. There is a cleaner approach we can take by creating a disposable wrapper around 
our object with a dispose method so that when our scope is complete, then the resource is automatically 
disposed through the using operator.

function DisposableWebSocket(url, protocol) {
  var socket = new WebSocket(url, protocol);

  // Create a way to close the WebSocket upon completion
  var d = Rx.Disposable.create(() => socket.close());

  d.socket = socket;

  return d;
}

var source = Rx.Observable.using(
  () => new DisposableWebSocket('ws://someurl', 'xmpp'),
  d => 
    Rx.Observable.from(data)
      .tap(data => d.socket.send(data));
  }
);

var subscription = source.subscribe();
Delaying Errors with mergeDelayError
Another issue may arise when you are dealing with flattening sequences into a single sequence and 
there may be errors along the way. We want a way to flatten without being interrupted by one of our 
sources being in error. This is much like the other operator mergeAll but the main difference is, 
instead of immediately bubbling up the error, it holds off until the very end.

To illustrate, we can create this little sample that has an errored sequence in the middle when it is 
trying to flatten the sequences.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3);
var source2 = Rx.Observable.throwError(new Error('woops'));
var source3 = Rx.Observable.of(4,5,6);

var source = Rx.Observable.mergeDelayError(source1, source2, source3);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
// => 4
// => 5
// => 6
// => Error: Error: woops
s

Transducers with Observable Sequences
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Much like Language Integrated Query (LINQ), Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. 
They, like LINQ, are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only 
the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled 
from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, 
observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate 
aggregates. There are two major libraries currently out there, Cognitect's transducer-js and James Long's 
transducers.js which are both great for getting high performance over large amounts of data. Because it 
is collection type neutral, it is a perfect fit for RxJS to do transformations over large collections.

The word transduce is just a combination of 
- transform and 
- reduce. 

The reduce function is the base transformation; any other transformation can be expressed in terms of it 
(map, filter, etc).

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

arr.reduce((result, x) => result.concat(x + 1), []);

// => [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Using transducers, we can model the following behavior while breaking apart the map aspect of 
adding 1 to the concat operation, adding the seed and then the "collection" to transduce.

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

function increment(x) { return x + 1; }
function concatItem(acc, x) { return acc.concat(x); }

transduce(map(increment), concatItem, [], arr);

// => [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Using Cognitect's transducers-js library, we can easily accomplish what we had above.

var t = transducers;

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

function increment(x) { return x + 1; }

into([], t.comp(t.map(increment)), arr);

// => [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
We can go a step further and add filtering as well to get only even values.

var t = transducers;

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

function increment(x) { return x + 1; }
function isEven(x) { return x % 2 === 0; }

into([], t.comp(t.map(increment), t.filter(isEven)), arr);

// => [ 2, 4 ]
Since it works so well using Arrays, there's no reason why it cannot work for Observable sequences as well. 
To that end, we have introduced the transduce method which acts exactly like it does for Arrays, but for
 Observable sequences. Once again, let's go over the above example, this time using an Observable sequence.

var t = transducers;

var source = Rx.Observable.range(1, 4);

function increment(x) { return x + 1; }
function isEven(x) { return x % 2 === 0; }

var transduced = source.transduce(t.comp(t.map(increment), t.filter(isEven)));

transduced.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => Next: 2
// => Next: 4
// => Completed
Note that this above example also works the same with transducers.js as well with little to no modification. 
This example will in fact work faster than the traditional LINQ style (as of now) which most use currently.

var source = Rx.Observable.range(1, 4);

function increment(x) { return x + 1; }
function isEven(x) { return x % 2 === 0; }

var transduced = source.map(increment).filter(isEven);

transduced.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => Next: 2
// => Next: 4
// => Completed
This opens up a wide new set of possibilities making RxJS even faster over large collections with no 
intermediate Observable sequences.

the next stream or Promise. Unlike catch, onErrorResumeNext will continue to the next sequence 
regardless of whether the previous was in error or not. To make this more concrete, let's use a 
simple example of mixing error sequences with normal sequences.

var source = Rx.Observable.onErrorResumeNext(
  Rx.Observable.just(42),
  Rx.Observable.throw(new Error()),
  Rx.Observable.just(56),
  Rx.Observable.throw(new Error()),
  Rx.Observable.just(78)
);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => console.log(data)
);
// => 42
// => 56
// => 78
The instance based onErrorResumeNext is similar to the class based version, the only difference being 
that it is attached to the prototype, but can take another sequence or Promise and continue.

Retrying Sequences
When catching errors isn't enough and we want to retry our logic, we can do so with retry or retryWhen 
operators. With the retry operator, we can try a certain operation a number of times before an error is 
thrown. This is useful when you need to get data from a resource which may have intermittent failures 
due to load or any other issue.

Let's take a look at a simple example of trying to get some data from a URL and giving up after three tries.

// Try three times to get the data and then give up
var source = get('url').retry(3);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => console.log(data),
  err => console.log(err)
);
In the above example, it will give up after three tries and thus call onError if it continues to fail 
after the third try. We can remedy that by adding catch to use an alternate source.

// Try three times to get the data and then return cached data if still fails
var source = get('url').retry(3).catch(cachedVersion());

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Displays the data from the URL or cached data
    console.log(data);
  }
);
The above case retries immediately upon failure. But what if you want to control when a retry happens? 
We have the retryWhen operator which allows us to deeply control when the next try happens. 
We incrementally back off trying again by using the following method:

var source = get('url').retryWhen(
   attempts =>
    attempts
      .zip(Observable.range(1, 3), (_, i) => i)
      .flatMap(i => {
        console.log('delay retry by ' + i + ' second(s)');
        return Rx.Observable.timer(i * 1000);
      });
);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    // Displays the data from the URL or cached data
    console.log(data);
  }
);
// => delay retry by 1 second(s)
// => delay retry by 2 second(s)
// => Data
Ensuring Cleanup with Finally
We've already covered the try/catch part of try/catch/finally, so what about finally? 
We have the finally operator which calls a function after the source sequence terminates 
gracefully or exceptionally. This is useful if you are using external resources or need to 
free up a particular variable upon completion.

In this example, we can ensure that our WebSocket will indeed be closed once the last message is processed.

var socket = new WebSocket('ws://someurl', 'xmpp');

var source = Rx.Observable.from(data)
  .finally(() => socket.close());

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  data => {
    socket.send(data);
  }
);
But we can do a better job in terms of managing resources if need be by using the using method.

Ensuring Resource Disposal
As stated above, finally can be used to ensure proper cleanup of any resources or perform any s
ide effects as necessary. There is a cleaner approach we can take by creating a disposable wrapper 
around our object with a dispose method so that when our scope is complete, then the resource is 
automatically disposed through the using operator.

function DisposableWebSocket(url, protocol) {
  var socket = new WebSocket(url, protocol);

  // Create a way to close the WebSocket upon completion
  var d = Rx.Disposable.create(() => socket.close());

  d.socket = socket;

  return d;
}

var source = Rx.Observable.using(
  () => new DisposableWebSocket('ws://someurl', 'xmpp'),
  d => 
    Rx.Observable.from(data)
      .tap(data => d.socket.send(data));
  }
);

var subscription = source.subscribe();
Delaying Errors with mergeDelayError
Another issue may arise when you are dealing with flattening sequences into a single sequence and 
there may be errors along the way. We want a way to flatten without being interrupted by one of our 
sources being in error. This is much like the other operator mergeAll but the main difference is, 
instead of immediately bubbling up the error, it holds off until the very end.


To illustrate, we can create this little sample that has an errored sequence in the middle when it is 
trying to flatten the sequences.

var source1 = Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3);
var source2 = Rx.Observable.throwError(new Error('woops'));
var source3 = Rx.Observable.of(4,5,6);

var source = Rx.Observable.mergeDelayError(source1, source2, source3);

var subscription = source.subscribe(
  x => console.log('onNext: %s', x),
  e => console.log('onError: %s', e),
  () => console.log('onCompleted'));

// => 1
// => 2
// => 3
// => 4
// => 5
// => 6
// => Error: Error: woops
