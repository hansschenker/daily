The field of Machine Learning (ML) is simply discovering
techniques to figure out this function.
Deep Learning (DL) is just one such technique.
Coding : Input + Fn -> Output
Machine Learning : Input + Output -> Fn

Variations of ML models
Supervised Learning : Input + Output -> Fn
Unsupervised Learning : Input -> Fn -> Nothing/ Input
Reinforcement Learning : Input + Output (sometimes) -> Fn


Paradigm shift: The world is a stream of data

Input	-> Function	-> Output	-> Label (Desired Output)	-> Loss (Label - Output)

There's no magic to neural networks - we modelled it after our brain
Each neuron in a neural netowrk can be seen as a feature
Weights determine how much weight we should give to each feature
This can be done for unstructured data like images

Structured vs unstructured data

Structured data - (table with fields and columns) house price prediction example

sUnstructured data - images, sound, natural language
Unstructured data has a structure too; just a very complex one


Start with random features and weights and keep changing them to reduce the loss

But this is very inefficient - so we use an algorithm called back propagation
Training - create the function from Training Data
Inference - make a prediction with the help of the function on test data

Thinking Fast and Slow

System 1 thinking: Fast thinking
System 2 thinking: Slow thinking
Deep learning is still very much about System 1 thinking

Vision vs perception

You seem to see the world in incredibly high resolution - but your brain is not
It's only seeing the most important features of the data it's getting from the eyes
Your vision is clearly different from your perception
Your perception is significantly compressing the raw data


Sensory inputs -> Brain processes them -> Make decisions and act


Section 1: Build a neural network with near infinite flexibility
Section 2: Back propagation algorithm to teach the machine to learn on its own
Section 3: Improve our network further
Section 4: Code up neural network from scratch using PyTorch
