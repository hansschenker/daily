Welcome back to the AI Advantage. I'm Igor and I've been using ChatGPT pretty much every single day for the past five to six months. And I've got to say it's been pretty life changing when it comes to how much output I can produce in a day. That's why today I'm going to talk about my five secrets to boosting your productivity with ChatGPT. Stick around because tricks like using follow up prompts well or involving the Zapier plugin in your work could literally save you hours every single week. And I don't say that lightly. And I'm pretty sure you haven't heard some of these before. And even the sponsor of this video Lupin is a productivity booster that can help you summarize meetings and then interact with them. But more on that later. So let's get into it. Secret number one is all about better research, because that's where a lot of tasks start. And these days with the vast amounts of information available on the internet, this can be overwhelming. But here's where ChatGPT's abilities come in handy, especially with plugins and internet browsing now. So let me show you exactly how I do it these days. Because inside of our free Notion template that you're probably already familiar with, you have to prompt summarize anything. And here's my tip. As with so many prompts that you might already have, enabling the browsing features might just super power it because now I'm going to be able to fill this out. For example, I'll take this blog article from our website. And now instead of filling out the thing that you want to summarize in here, I can simply add the article in the end. And here I'll say article and as my target audience, I'll fill out AI enthusiasts because that's what all of us kind of are. And again, make sure to enable browsing with Bing. This is only available with ChatGPT+. But now it's going to consider all of the context inside of that link. Really, it's a minor upgrade. But you got to start thinking about this every time you run a prompt. Because as you might know, the quality of the output here is all about how much context you give it. And a link is one of the best ways of providing it with context. So there you go a fantastic summary of this article. And it's that simple. This is really the thing that I've been researching with all day. Now you just add an article to the end. And look, if it doesn't work on the first try, don't be frustrated. This browsing feature is still in beta, but usually by running it two to three times, you get it to work. And with that being said, let's move on to the next secret to productivity. And what I'll be doing is making these progressively advanced. So this one was pretty basic. And the next one is about writing anything, which is also a concept you're familiar with. But we're going to go a little deeper here. Because again, the write anything prompt from the free ebook is nothing revolutionary, you probably know this one already. But here's the trick that I want you to deploy, you're going to run it in the context of your conversation and not in a new one, right? Because now we researched what this article is all about. And we're going to keep prompting within that context. And I gotta say this one is so customizable, I'm just going to take the prompt example here. And here's my tip, you can actually make your life easier because we did specify the target audience already. So I could remove that building block, right? And a building block is just how I teach how to prompt because even the most complex prompt is made up of various building blocks, the most basic ones being instruction and context. So write me an email is the instruction and to my boss is the context. And these different building blocks are just various ways to express that context so I can remove the ones that have already been dealt with in my conversations. So I told it about my target audience. So for type of text, we can say tweet. And here's the cool thing, we get to make our lives so much easier because we have the subject above already, we can just say above subject, and we don't need a location here. And actually even for key benefits, we can just remove the square brackets. And maybe here in the end, I'll say article. And really that involves zero creativity, except of saying it's a tweet. All I need is a style now. But again, in the free template, I could just take one of these style presets like the Wall Street Journal. And as you can see, when I'm operating within a conversation like this, often I can keep the variables in as they are because it has the context above already, right? So I'll just say using the Wall Street Journal writing style, write a tweet for the above subject highlighting the key benefits offered by that article. Okay, not bad. How about one more follow up in the sequence saying five more. And there you go. That's my brain that approach to literally writing anything you first research it with browsing. And then you run one of these prompt formulas that involves minimal decision making to use the internet research it did. And if you want to make a change or create different types of text, you can always go back to your history, scroll up a little bit. And by hitting this button, you can go ahead and say, write a LinkedIn article, write a cover letter, presentation, email, the list goes on, you get the point. I'll just save and submit. And again, super low effort. And I can generate anything based on this research. Cool. Alright, so the next secret is going to be all about brainstorming ideas with the new capabilities we got here with both browsing and plugins. But I first want to tell you about this app that I actually use in my workflows. And they happened to reach out and wanted to sponsor this video. So it could be a better fit as this helps to improve my personal productivity on a regular basis. Lupin is an AI meeting assistant that's designed to streamline your customer facing team meetings. And I believe it could be a game changer for many of you think about how many times you've had to scramble for meeting notes, or you've struggled to remember key action items from your last project kickoff, or maybe you've spent unnecessary time switching context between different meetings. It can be a headache, right? Well, this is where Lupin comes in. Lupin removes the hassle from meetings by offering concise meeting summaries and automated recaps. And here's the cool It's like having a conversational assistant at your disposal. Lupin uses AI technology to transcribe your meeting recordings and generate meeting minutes. This means you can focus on a conversation on the actual meeting instead of worrying about making notes. Moreover, Lupin's AI technology also connects related meetings together to help you resurface important discussions and notes. So if you're prepping for an upcoming meeting, you can switch context within seconds getting all the information you need effortlessly. And with a brand new feature called Ask Lupin AI, you can ask anything about your meeting and get the relevant clarifications or answers from the meeting transcripts. But that's not all. Lupin also allows you to maintain your meeting momentum by sharing meeting notes with your team via email, Slack, or Notion automatically. You can create automations to follow up on tasks, driving accountability without those endless status update meetings. And to top it all off, Lupin works where you work. It integrates seamlessly with Gmail, Slack, Zoom, Notion, Asana, and even has the upcoming features for Hotspot, Jira, and Microsoft Office. Lupin is free to start with no credit card needed and can be added straight to your Chrome browser. It's trusted by teams and companies you know, including ours. It's designed to make your meetings more effective with minimal effort. So if you're someone who wants to focus on a conversation rather than on taking notes, wants to connect the dots between related meetings, or wants to maintain the momentum after the meeting ends, I'd recommend giving Lupin a try. You can find the link to their website in the description below. Remember, in this age of technology and AI, we should leverage these tools not only to increase our productivity, but also to create a more enjoyable work experience. And Lupin does just that. Alright, time to talk about brainstorming ideas as this is one of the essential capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4. It's one of the biggest roadblocks to being productive is actually getting started. And often that starts with a good idea. And this has been flat out one of the best use cases of ChatGPT so far. It can kickstart your ideation process. And again, this is a prompt inside the free Notion template. So as you can see, I really want to show you how to go deeper with some of these and all these concepts apply to every single prompt you might have in your very own database. And if I just fill in the words with square brackets, I get a prompt that can ideate ideas for YouTube series like this. And that works very well. But here's the kicker. If I go into the plugin store and install this one called Voxscript and enable it here, I can use the same prompt and I'll just extend it with this little building block based on other successful cooking videos. And by extending this with based on other cooking videos, I can use the capabilities of Voxscript, which you can look up in the free plugin base that we provide here. Because in the second column that shows the features, benefits and examples, you will see that this can not only get YouTube video data, it can also search YouTube videos. So it can search YouTube for you and then it will get the transcript of that video and consider it as the context of your ideation prompt. And again, we put out this entire thing for free, you can find it in the description and search the entire thing for whatever you might need, whatever you might be ideating. But I'll just go ahead and run this. And now I have an idea generation assistant that went out, searched YouTube, analyzed some of the transcripts and came up with some informed ideas that are up to date to what I'm looking for. And by simply adding use Voxscript to base it on other cooking videos, I can really bring this prompt to the next level. And there you go. Here's your brainstorming result that is actually based on facts that Voxscript retrieved from YouTube. And look, when you open it up, you can see the five videos it based its research upon really altering the results and giving you more relevant information for your brainstorming. And again, all we had to do is customize the idea generation formula a little bit and know what plugin helps us out. And both of those are way easier with the ChatGPT plugin database that we provide and the free ChatGPT Advantage Notion template that has these prompt formulas. As you can see, a lot of the hidden powers are within combining some of these different tricks. And let me tell you, with over 200 plugins and 250 prompts inside of the template, which is actually over 1000 prompts inside of my course template, once you start combining those, the possibilities are endless. Now let's talk about the next productivity secret, which takes a completely different approach than the ones up until now. This one is going to be about using ChatGPT to improve yourself, concretely your writing, because that is the number one skill that will help you unlock productivity. If you get better at writing, you will also get better at thinking and therefore communicating, which eventually allows you to tap into your true potential. But the thing with writing is it's kind of hard to practice. And while that does make sense to a lot of people, it's kind of hard to get better at writing. There's no clear way even if you want to. Well, guess what? ChatGPT can help you here too. So yeah, this little prompt formula here will create a writing exercise for you that you can follow in here, which makes it way more interactive and lowers the barrier to entry. So for example, something useful for me would be develop an argumentative writing exercise for beginner writers that involves defending the use of AI in daily life with a focus on improving persuasive skills and clarity of thought. And this is my tip here focusing on persuasion skills and clarity of thought is excellent. And I'll just run this in GPT 3.5. And there you go a step by step instruction on how to improve the skill. And you can even follow up with act as a writing tutor and guide me through task one. And it's going to act as a teacher and introduce you to what to do in this exercise. And hey, look, I realized this is no quick win as a lot of the other ones, right? This one is actually going to build your skills for the long term. But just realize that you can use this prompt to really learn any skill, it's going to give you various exercises, and then you can ask it to act as a tutor, which makes learning stuff so much easier. And now what you can do is use this prompt act as a seasoned writing coach with clear yet friendly communication based on my writing below analyze my writing performance and give me feedback based on the goal of the exercise. Here's my attempt. And then you just paste what you created. Let's just say it was this as with every advantage video, you can find the prompts and the links to the resources are referenced in the description below. So feel free to use that to your advantage. But as you can see here, it gave us feedback on how we did with the writing exercise. And then we can move on to the next one rinse and repeat and generally get better with the help of AI. Okay, and here's secret number five. And I realized this one could and probably should be a video of its own. But it's really about Zapier. And if you're not aware, this is the way to automate your AI workflows, it's going to allow you to do certain operations like send emails, create folders, move files around, and then run prompts on top of those files and save the results to different folders and send them to people all on its own. So what I want to do is give you a bird's eye overview how this works. And if you care to learn more, you can leave a comment below and I can create a video on the detailed step by step. But essentially, my big tip here is they have a blog article that outlines how this works in detail. So I'll include that in the description below. But essentially, there's two ways to use this to your advantage. One is inside of chat GPT, like so by enabling the plugin. And the second one is by actually using their website and then linking to chat GPT. For both of those, you will need to log in, you can just log in with your Google account, which happens to be your YouTube account too. Once you're logged in, the plugin really is all about this, you have to go to this actions page, again, link in the description below. And here you can add the various actions that you want to enable inside of chat GPT. For example, we have one where I linked my Gmail, and it allows me to send emails now. Okay, so now I can literally send emails from within chat GPT. So I'll do send an email to email address saying that I feel great today in the style of Borat. And there you go, it prepared a draft, because that's how I set it up. I don't want it to send it out right away. I wanted to put it into my drafts. And I could just click this link. And I'll see my email that has been prepared for me. I started using this all the time recently. Yakshamash, I'm feeling very nice. High five. Chenkui, Igor. And as you can see, I didn't provide it with my name. So it left a placeholder here. And it's going to send the email from me to me, I guess. But this is really how it works. And as I pointed out, there's also a second way to use this, which is not from within chat GPT. And they also outlined it here. So if you frequently send emails like this, we can set up a zap workflow to automate the process, you just need to specify a trigger and the email will be sent automatically. And look at that, I just received this wonderful email. And it was all done from within here. I just had to confirm it on this web page that it linked. So here's my recommendation, create a trial account, set up something super simple like sending an email, play around with this inside of chat GPT. And once you find the ones that you use regularly, then start exploring Zapier's interface where you can automate all that and add so called triggers and triggers are essentially what the prompt is here. It's what activates that action, right? Because all this automation stuff boils down to triggers and action, the action is sending the email and the trigger is in this case, me telling it to send an email. But in other cases, it might be Hey, when a new file is added to this particular folder, I want you to send an email to my marketing manager that it just appeared there. So to put it concisely, because I've been using prompt number four to train my ability to speak concisely. If you're experimenting, use chat GPT with Zapier. If you do things recurrently, use their web interface and automate it. I should say one more thing. And that is that you can start combining these. So for example, we looked at voxscript and Zapier in this video. So I could just take the two of these search YouTube, take the transcripts, send emails with some of the ideas that I discovered they're all from within chat GPT. And yeah, the same thing goes for the entire plugin store with over 200 plugins. So again, you can use our free resource to explore and search all of these. And again, Zapier is super deep. But if I click the first column, it will show me a bunch of obvious opportunities. And in the second column, I can find out how this could improve my work life balance. And last but not least, in the third one, I can see why I should be using this over plain chat GPT. And there you go. Those are literally the top secrets to increase productivity with the use of chat GPT that I use on an everyday basis. If you want to go beyond these tips, it's really all about improving your prompts, adding building blocks, adding context and making the results better. And there's no one YouTube video I can teach you that. And that's why I created my prompt engineering course where I have over 30 videos that teach you the skill of crafting custom prompts. And as mentioned, you'll find everything I mentioned in the description below. And if this still wasn't enough, and you want to learn even more about plugins and their capabilities, well, this video does exactly that. Because let me tell you, this Wolfram plugin is low key insane. And it can be combined with everything we talked about here. So check this out and I'll see you soon.
