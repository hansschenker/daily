The Apo B to Apo A1 Ratio
Dr. Dicken Weatherby & Beth Ellen DiLuglio, MS, RDN, LDN
There is so much more to cholesterol than meets the eye!

Apolipoproteins are structural, functional components of lipoproteins that facilitate cholesterol transport in the blood.

ApoB is a constituent of VLDL and LDL.
ApoA1 is a constituent of HDL.
Research indicates that evaluating the ratio of ApoB to ApoA1 is a better tool for assessing coronary artery disease than evaluating traditional biomarkers such as total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, or lipid ratios including total cholesterol/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c, and TG/HDL-c.

An increasing ratio of ApoB to ApoA1 represents increased cardiovascular risk due to a relative increase in atherogenic ApoB or a decrease in protective ApoA1.
The ratio is strongly related to risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as other cardiovascular disorders.
Researchers suggest the use of ApoB:ApoA1 ratio as an integral component of cardiovascular risk assessment, especially in those with blood lipids within the normal range.[i]
A 5-year follow up of 1,639 coronary heart disease patients found that those with a higher ApoB:ApoA1 ratio had

significantly increased risk of complications including multi-branch lesions, angina, MI, hear failure, stroke, and death due to cardiac causes.
When adjusted for age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, and hypertension, the highest quartile for ApoB:ApoA1 ratio was 1.93 (1.1-3.13) while the lowest quartile ratio was
The ratio was considered superior to the Framingham Risk Score and total cholesterol to HDL ratio for assessing severity and outcome of established coronary heart disease.[ii]
The ratio of ApoB to ApoA1 is useful in the assessment of metabolic syndrome risk as well. A 2009 health nutrition survey of 8,120 subjects in China revealed that both males and females in the highest quartile of ApoB:ApoA1 (0.98 or greater) were at a significant 4.24-fold greater risk of metabolic syndrome compared to the lowest quartile (0.61).[iii]

One study looked at metabolic syndrome risk in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and revealed an association between ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and metabolic syndrome in men and women. In women an association was also observed between elevated ApoB:ApoA1 and ischemic cardiomyopathy.[iv]

Clinical Implications High	Clinical Implications Low
Atherosclerotic plaque [v]
Cardiovascular disease risk increase [vi]
Metabolic syndrome
Rheumatoid arthritis [vii]
Statin therapy monitoring [viii]
Stroke [ix]
 

A low/desirable ApoB/Apo A-1 ratio represents decreased atherogenic ApoB and a relative increase in protective Apo A-1
Calculating The Ratio - Let ODX Do the Work!
Good news! The ApoB:Apo A-1 ratio is now being automatically calculated by the Optimal DX software if both the ApoB and Apo A-1 are added into the system. No need to do any conversions as the software will do this for you and will now show the result in the Blood Test Results Report:

apob_apoa1_ratio

However, if you simply want to do the calculation manually then please follow these instructions:

The ApoB:Apo A-1 ratio is calculated by dividing the ApoB result by the Apo A-1result.

Here's an example:

ApoB is 105  and the Apo A-1 is 95: 105/ 95= 1.11
So, the ApoB:Apo A1 Ratio in this example is 1.11
