Abstract algebra
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about a branch of mathematics. For the Swedish band, see Abstrakt Algebra.

--------------------------------------------------
a fundamental concept within abstract algebra.
In mathematics, more specifically algebra, abstract algebra or modern algebra is the study 
of algebraic structures.[1] 

Algebraic structures
--------------------------------------------------
include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras over a field. 
The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish it from older parts of algebra, 
and more specifically from elementary algebra, 
the use of variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning. 

Presently, the term "abstract algebra" is typically used for naming courses in mathematical education, 
and is rarely used in advanced mathematics.

Algebraic structures, with their associated homomorphisms, form mathematical categories. 
Category theory is a formalism that allows a unified way for expressing properties and constructions 
that are similar for various structures.

Universal algebra is a related subject that studies types of algebraic structures as single objects. 
For example, 

the structure of groups 
--------------------------------------------------
is a single object in universal algebra, which is called the variety of groups
