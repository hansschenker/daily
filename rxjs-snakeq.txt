to code a rxjs snake game: I first have create all my input observables:
To code an RxJS snake game, you first need to create all the necessary input observables.

These input observables will allow you to handle user input, such as arrow key presses, 
and use it to control the movement of the snake in the game.

For example, you might create an observable for the "keydown" event on the document object, 
which will emit events whenever a key is pressed. You can then use operators like "filter" and "map" 
to transform these events into the appropriate direction for the snake to move in.

You may also need to create observables for other user input, such as mouse clicks or touch events, 
depending on the requirements of your game.

Once you have these input observables set up, you can use them to control the movement of the snake 
and implement the rest of the game logic using RxJS operators and patterns.




Given I have setup board of 30 by 30 cells and placed an initial snake with 3 cells in width in 
the middle of the board and also place a food with 1 cell width on a random cell on the board, 
When the user presses a key arrow and a timer is running I can move the snake in the direction 
of the last keypress and check wheter the snake collides with the food, the board border or itself. 
In a collison case with the food, a new  food gets randomly placed and the snake grows 1 cell longer, 
in a collision with itself the player looses the game
Sure, here's an example of how you could implement the game logic you described in RxJS:

import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs';
import { map, filter, takeWhile, scan } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Define the initial state of the game
const initialState = {
  boardSize: 30,
  snake: {
    direction: 'right',
    body: [
      { x: 14, y: 15 },
      { x: 13, y: 15 },
      { x: 12, y: 15 }
    ]
  },
  food: { x: 3, y: 3 }
};

// Define observables for user input and timer
const arrowKeys$ = fromEvent(document, 'keydown').pipe(
  map((event: KeyboardEvent) => event.key),
  filter(key => ['ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight'].includes(key))
);

const timer$ = interval(100);

// Combine the arrowKeys$ and timer$ observables to create a stream of game ticks
const game$ = arrowKeys$.pipe(
  map(key => {
    // Update the direction of the snake based on the arrow key pressed
    switch (key) {
      case 'ArrowUp':
        return 'up';
      case 'ArrowDown':
        return 'down';
      case 'ArrowLeft':
        return 'left';
      case 'ArrowRight':
        return 'right';
    }
  }),
  filter(direction => {
    // Ignore input that would cause the snake to reverse direction
    const currentDirection = state.snake.direction;
    return !(direction === 'up' && currentDirection === 'down' ||
             direction === 'down' && currentDirection === 'up' ||
             direction === 'left' && currentDirection === 'right' ||
             direction === 'right' && currentDirection === 'left');
  }),
  scan((state, direction) => {
    // Move the snake in the given direction, checking for collisions with food, border, or itself
    const head = state.snake.body[0];
    let newHead;
    switch (direction) {
      case 'up':
        newHead = { x: head.x, y: head.y - 1 };
        break;
      case 'down':
        newHead = { x: head.x, y: head.y + 1 };
        break;
      case 'left':
        newHead = { x: head.x - 1, y: head.y };
        break;
      case 'right':
        newHead = { x: head.x + 1, y: head.y };
        break;
    }
    const newSnake = { direction, body: [newHead, ...state.snake.body.slice(0, -1)] };
    let newFood = state.food;
    let gameOver = false;
    if (newHead.x < 0 || newHead.x >= state.boardSize || newHead.y < 0 || newHead.y >= state.boardSize) {
      // Collision with border
      gameOver = true;
    } else if (newHead.x === state.food.x && newHead.y === state.food.y) {
      // Collision with food
      newSnake.body.push(state.snake.body[state.snake.body.length - 1]);
      newFood = { x: Math.floor(Math.random() * state.boardSize), y: Math.floor(Math.random() * state.boardSize) };
    } else if (newSnake.body.slice(1).some(cell => cell.x === newHead.x && cell.y === newHead.y)) {
      // Collision with self
      gameOver = true;
    }
    return {
      boardSize: state
    }

Based on the scenario you described, it sounds like you have already set up the initial game board 
with a snake and food. To move the snake based on user input, you will need to subscribe to the 
"keydown" event on the document object and use an RxJS operator to map the event to the 
appropriate direction for the snake to move.

Once you have the direction, you can update the position of the snake on the game board with 
each tick of the timer. You can use RxJS operators to handle collisions with the food, board border, 
and the snake itself.

If the snake collides with the food, you can generate a new random location for the food and add a 
new cell to the snake to make it longer. If the snake collides with the board border or itself, 
you can end the game and display a message to the user.

To implement the logic for checking collisions, you will need to use conditional statements and 
compare the current position of the snake with the position of the food, board border, and other 
cells in the snake. You can use RxJS operators like "filter" to handle collisions and "tap" to 
perform actions like generating a new random location for the food or ending the game.

Overall, implementing a snake game with RxJS will require combining several different operators 
and patterns to 
- handle user input, 
- game logic (loop) , and 
- collisions.
