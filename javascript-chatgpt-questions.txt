what is railway oriented programming - scott wlashin railway oriented programming
-------------------------------------
Railway-oriented programming (ROP) is a programming paradigm and a pattern for designing error-handling 
in functional programming languages. It is a way of handling errors and success cases 
in a functional, composable and readable manner.

In ROP, the flow of control is represented as a railway track with two rails: one for the 
success case and one for the failure case. A function that may produce an error is represented 
as a railway switch that can direct the flow of control to either the success or the failure rail.

This pattern makes it possible to write code that is easy to understand, debug, and maintain by 
separating error handling from the main flow of logic. Additionally, it allows for clean composition 
of functions that return either success or failure results, making it easier to build 
complex systems out of smaller, simpler components.
