Template Engine
-----------------

Template engines are used when you want to rapidly build web applications that are split into different components

- Layout (Html)
- Static Binding - Dynamic Binding, Binding Function (when ever data property changes , binding function is run again)
- Data   (Javascript values or objects)    

Template engines are mostly used for server-side applications that are run on only one server and are not built as APIs

How template engines work
When you build a server-side application with a template engine, the template engine replaces the variables 
in a template file with actual values, and displays this value to the client
