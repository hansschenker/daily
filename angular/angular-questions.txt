interview so we are gonna have 50

questions 15 of them are gonna be fairly

easy 15 are gonna be of an intermediate
is what is angular 
this is a very basic
---------------------
39
question that might be or may not be
41
asked to you in an angular interview
42
depending on what level of experience
44
you have so let's get on with it
47
so angular is a front-end development
49
framework front-end development refers
51
to anything that a website has that you
54
can see so developing any button the
58
whole design aspect is basically
01:00
front-end development and angler in the
01:02
framework that helps you in such
01:03
development I love that angular is
01:06
maintained and developed by Google so
01:08
it's a front-end development framework
01:10
that is made by Google and it's still
01:12
developed by and it's still maintained
01:14
by Google above that angular is a
01:16
typescript based framework typescript is
01:18
a superset of JavaScript so angular can
01:21
also be called a JavaScript based
01:23
framework nessing's javascript is so
01:26
commonly used online it is a very good
01:29
thing that angular is JavaScript based
01:31
above that angular is used for creating
01:34
SBA's or single page applications some
01:38
good examples of single page
01:39
applications are Gmail Google Maps
01:42
Facebook and github moving on to our
01:44
next question
01:45
of the day and that is what is the
01:48
difference between angularjs and angular
01:50
the difference between angularjs and
01:53
angular
01:54
are quite a few firstly let's talk about
01:56
architecture so angularjs supports the
01:59
MVC design model while angular uses
02:02
components in directives on the side of
02:05
language angularjs is using javascript
02:08
while angular uses typescript
02:11
expressions and syntax we can say that
02:13
specific ng directives is required for
02:16
image and property and of an event on
02:18
the other hand angular uses the
02:21
parentheses and square brackets for
02:23
events in property binding respectively
02:26
on the topic of mobile support angularjs
02:29
doesn't provide any mobile support while
02:31
angular has tons of mobile support for
02:34
routing angularjs uses the dollar route
02:37
provider dot Venn method and is used for
02:40
routing configs and for angular we are
02:44
looking at the route config and it is
02:46
used for routing configurations another
02:49
major difference between angularjs and
02:51
angular is angularjs has no support for
02:54
the concept of dependency injection
02:56
while angular supports hierarchical
02:58
dependency injection with a
03:00
unidirectional tree based change
03:02
detection on the topic a structure
03:04
angularjs is considerably less
03:07
manageable than angular because of
03:09
angular simplified structure that makes
03:11
development and maintenance of large
03:13
applications much much easier then on
03:16
the topic of speed angularjs with its
03:19
two-way data-binding in development
03:21
efforts are quite quite fast but
03:23
angularjs since it is an upgrade has
03:25
much more fast features on the topic of
03:28
support angularjs has no support or no
03:31
new updates as it is deprecated on the
03:34
other hand angular has support and
03:36
frequent new updates almost every six
03:39
months you get a new version of angular
03:41
moving on to the next question is what
03:44
are the various features of angular so
03:46
the various features of angular can be
03:49
charted down in these few points that we
03:52
have here so the first one is
03:54
accessibility of applications angular
03:57
allows creating accessible applications
03:59
using Aria and abled components built in
04:03
a 1:1 why test infrastructure and
04:05
developer guides then the next feature
04:08
is the angular CLI now angular provides
04:10
support for command-line interface tools
04:13
these tools can be used for adding
04:15
components testing instant deploying etc
04:18
then is animation support so angular is
04:21
intuitive API allows the creation of
04:23
high performance
04:24
complex animation timelines with very
04:27
little code cross-platform
04:29
app development so angular can be used
04:32
for building an efficient powerful
04:33
desktop native and progressive web apps
04:36
angular provides support for building
04:38
native mobile applications using Cordova
04:40
ionic or need a script angler uses
04:43
creating high-performance offline and
04:46
zero step installation progressive web
04:48
apps using modern web platform
04:50
capabilities the popular JavaScript
04:52
framework can also be used for building
04:55
desktop apps for Linux Mac OS and
04:58
Windows the first point is code
05:00
generation so angler is able to convert
05:03
templates into highly optimized code for
05:06
modern JavaScript virtual machines next
05:09
point is code splitting so with the new
05:12
component router angular apps load
05:14
quickly the component router offers
05:16
automatic code splitting so that only
05:18
the code required to render the view
05:20
that is requested by a user is loaded
05:23
the next point is synergy with popular
05:25
code editors and IDE S which is always a
05:28
plus so angular offers code completion
05:31
instant error etc with popular source
05:34
code editors and IDE s the second last
05:37
point is of templates so angular allows
05:40
reading UI views with a simple and
05:42
powerful template syntax and the last is
05:45
testing so angular lets you carry out
05:47
frequent unit tests using karma the
05:50
protractor allows running fastest
05:52
scenario tests in a stable way the next
05:55
question that you might face yourself in
05:57
an angular interview is that could you
06:00
explain services in angular
06:02
so singleton objects in angular that
06:05
gets instantiated only once during the
06:07
lifetime of an application are called
06:09
services an angular service contains
06:12
methods that maintain the data
06:14
throughout the life of an application
06:16
the primary intent of an angular service
06:19
is to organize as well as share business
06:21
logic models or data and functions with
06:24
various components of an angular
06:25
application
06:28
the functions offered by an angular
06:29
service can be invoked from any angular
06:31
component such as a controller or
06:33
directive now moving on to the next
06:36
question and that is what are the
06:38
advantages of using angular well
06:41
following are the various advantages of
06:43
using angular the first is the ability
06:46
to add a custom directive exceptional
06:48
community support facilitates client and
06:52
server communication features strong
06:54
features such as animation and event
06:56
handlers follows the MVC pattern
06:59
architecture offers support for static
07:01
template and angular template supports
07:04
for two-way data-binding
07:05
supports for dependency injection
07:07
restful services and validation now
07:10
since we have a question on the
07:12
advantages it would make sense only to
07:15
have a question on the disadvantages and
07:17
that is what are the disadvantages of
07:19
using angular and these are the
07:22
disadvantages so complex s pas can be
07:25
inconvenient and laggy to use due to
07:27
their size dynamic applications do not
07:30
always perform well and learning angular
07:32
requires a decent time and effort now
07:36
the next question is one that can change
07:38
with versions of angular so currently
07:41
we're on version 8 so the interviewer
07:44
might ask you what's new in angular 8
07:46
just to test your knowledge on whether
07:48
you're up-to-date or not so in angular 8
07:51
the new things are the IV engine which
07:53
is the next generation compilation and
07:56
rendering pipeline which reduces the
07:57
bundle size loads faster
07:59
and in slower networks and is simply
08:01
easy to use the next new update is the
08:04
basel engine so google open source the
08:07
software responsible for building most
08:09
of their projects under the name basil
08:11
basil is a powerful tool which keeps
08:13
track of other dependencies between
08:15
different packages and build targets the
08:18
coolest feature of basil is that it has
08:19
a smart algorithm for determining the
08:21
pill dependencies so basically it is a
08:24
tool that is to help web pack but not
08:26
replace it another most important thing
08:30
that is there in angular 8 is
08:32
differential loading so differential
08:34
loading is a process by which the
08:35
browser chooses between modern or legacy
08:37
JavaScript based on its own capabilities
08:40
we now take advantage of the stay
08:42
fault by performing a modern build and a
08:44
legacy build of your application and
08:46
when users load your application they'll
08:49
automatically get the bundle they need
08:51
moving on to our next question is what
08:54
is string interpolation so for string
08:57
interpolation I'm just gonna show it to
08:59
you instead of reading our an answer so
09:02
first let me explain what string
09:03
interpolation is so also referred to as
09:06
a mustache syntax string interpolation
09:08
in angular refers to a special type of
09:11
syntax that makes use of Stepford
09:13
expression in order to display the
09:15
component data these template
09:17
expressions are enclosed within double
09:18
curly braces I'll just show that to you
09:20
what I mean the JavaScript expressions
09:23
are to be executed by angular are added
09:25
between curly braces and corresponding
09:27
output is embedded into the HTML code
09:30
typically these expressions are updated
09:32
and registered like washes as a part of
09:34
a digest cycle so let me just show it to
09:36
you how that looks
09:37
let's open up vs code
09:41
so now that we have opened up vs code
09:43
let me to show you
09:45
so this out here is string interpolation
09:47
we are interpolating the word clicks so
09:50
clicks goes through the number of clicks
09:54
in a counter if you want to know what
09:55
this is about you can go ahead and check
09:58
out my angular tutorial where we go
10:00
through several assignments after each
10:02
section of learning this is one of the
10:04
assignments and I have enough faith in
10:07
that that you will have fun solving
10:08
these assignments okay so this is what
10:11
string interpolation is now let's get
10:13
back to our interview questions without
10:15
wasting much time and the next question
10:18
of the day is explain the tenth occasion
10:21
and authorization so the user login
10:23
credentials are passed to an
10:25
authenticate API which is present on the
10:27
server post server validation of the
10:30
credentials a JWT or a JSON web token is
10:34
returned the JWT has information on
10:37
attributes regarding the current user
10:39
the user is then identified at the given
10:41
JWT
10:42
and this is called authentication now
10:44
post logging in successfully different
10:47
users have a different level of access
10:48
while some may access everything access
10:52
for others might be restricted to only
10:53
some resources and the level of access
10:56
is authorization now moving on we have
10:59
another question and that is explain
11:01
scope hierarchy in angular so angular
11:05
organizes the scope with the dollar
11:07
scope object into a hierarchy that is
11:09
typically used by views this is known as
11:12
scope hierarchy in angular it has a root
11:15
scope that can further contain one or
11:17
several scopes called child scopes misko
11:20
hierarchy each view has its own scope
11:23
hence a variable set by a views view
11:25
controller will remain hidden to other
11:27
view controllers so the next question is
11:31
how to generate a class using the CLI
11:34
so I'll just show you the command to
11:36
generate a class using the CLI all you
11:39
have to do is open up your command
11:41
prompt go to the folder that you want to
11:44
create your class in and all you have to
11:46
say ng generate class and the name of
11:50
the class so we can calls class dummy
11:52
and this will generate a class
11:55
see you I'm not gonna execute this
11:57
command because it'll just end up
11:58
wasting our time so we just go head to
12:01
the next question and that is what are
12:04
templates and angular so templates and
12:06
angular
12:07
are written with HTML that contains
12:09
angular specific elements and attributes
12:11
these templates are combined with
12:13
information coming from the model in
12:15
controller which are further rendered to
12:17
provide the dynamic view to the user
12:19
moving on to question number thirteen
12:22
and that is annotations versus
12:24
decorators so what is the difference
12:26
between an annotation and a decorator in
12:29
angular so in angular annotations are
12:32
only metadata sets of the class using
12:35
the reflect metadata library they are
12:37
used to create an annotation array on
12:39
the other hand decorators are the design
12:42
patterns that are used for separating
12:45
decorations or modifications of a class
12:47
without actually altering the original
12:49
source code so that was annotations and
12:52
decorators moving on to the next
12:54
question and that is what is a directive
12:57
in angular the directives are markers on
13:00
the Dom elements that tell angularjs to
13:03
attach a specific behavior to that Dom
13:05
element or even transfer the Dom element
13:07
and it's children in short it extends
13:10
the HTML most of the directives in
13:13
angularjs are starting with ng - paren G
13:16
stands for angular angularjs includes
13:19
various built in directives in addition
13:22
to this you can create custom directives
13:24
for your own application moving on to
13:26
the next question is explain the types
13:29
of directors so there are three kinds of
13:32
directives in angular components
13:34
that's component directives with the
13:36
template structure directives so they
13:38
change the Dom layout by adding and
13:40
removing Dom elements then there are
13:42
attribute directive so these chains
13:44
appearance or behavior of an element
13:46
component or another directive the
13:48
components are the most common of the
13:50
three directives you saw a confident for
13:52
the first time in the getting started
13:54
tutorial and you can check out this
13:56
tutorial by going through my angular 8
13:59
tutorial
13:59
another one is structural directives
14:02
that change the structure of the view a
14:04
good example of structural directive is
14:06
ng if and ng for you can learn
14:09
my angular tutorial to another one is
14:12
attribute directives and these are used
14:14
as attributes of elements the built-in
14:16
ng style directive in a template syntax
14:19
guide for example can change the several
14:21
element styles at the same time okay
14:24
moving on to our next question and this
14:27
begins to mark off the intermediate
14:29
level of questions and that is what is
14:32
data binding and it's different types in
14:34
angular data binding is one of the most
14:36
powerful and important features that
14:38
allow you to define the communication
14:40
between the components and the document
14:42
object model
14:43
it basically simplifies the process of
14:45
defining interactive applications
14:48
without having to worry about pushing
14:49
and pulling data between your view or
14:51
template and confident in angular there
14:54
are four forms of data binding
14:56
the first one is string interpolation
14:58
second one is property binding the third
15:01
one is event winding and the fourth one
15:03
is two-way data binding now what are the
15:06
differences between angular and jQuery
15:09
is our next question so these are the
15:12
differences between jQuery and angular
15:14
so jQuery supports Dom manipulation
15:17
which is similar to angular jQuery also
15:20
has no restful api while angular
15:22
supports restful api jQuery has
15:25
animation support while angular has
15:27
animation support too
15:29
jQuery has no deep linking routing
15:31
animation while angular has support for
15:34
deep linking routing jQuery has no form
15:37
of validation while angular supports all
15:40
sorts of forms of validation jQuery has
15:43
no two-way data-binding
15:45
angular supports two-way data-binding
15:47
jQuery supports ax while angular also
15:50
supports ax these are a few similarities
15:53
and dissimilarities between jQuery and
15:56
angular that you can pitch and your
15:58
angular interview now moving on to
16:00
question number 18 and that is what are
16:03
the building blocks of an angular
16:04
application so there are essentially
16:07
nine building blocks of an angular
16:08
application and these are as follows the
16:12
first one is a component a component
16:13
controls one or more views each view is
16:16
some specific section of the screen
16:18
every angular application has at least
16:20
one component known
16:22
the root formant it is bootstrapped
16:24
inside the main module known as the root
16:27
module a component contains application
16:29
logic defined inside a class this class
16:32
is responsible for interacting with the
16:34
view via and API of properties and
16:36
methods the second is data binding
16:39
mechanism by which parts of a template
16:41
coordinate with the parts of the
16:43
component is known as data binding in
16:45
order to let angular know how to connect
16:47
both sides that is templates and is
16:49
confident the binding markup is added to
16:51
the template HTML the third is
16:54
dependency injection angular makes use a
16:57
dependency injection to provide required
16:59
dependencies to new confidence typically
17:02
dependency is required by a component
17:03
our services a confidence constructor
17:06
parameter tells angular about the
17:08
services that a confident requires so a
17:10
dependency injection offers a way to
17:12
supply fully form dependencies required
17:14
by a new instance of a class
17:16
the fourth is directives the template
17:19
used by angular are dynamic in nature
17:21
directives are responsible for
17:23
instructing angular about how to
17:25
transform the Dom when rendering a
17:27
template actually components are
17:29
directives with the template other types
17:31
of directives are attributes and
17:33
structured directives the fist building
17:36
block is of metadata so in order to let
17:38
angular know how to process a class
17:40
metadata is attached to the class for
17:42
doing so decorators are used the sixth
17:46
one is modules also known as ng modules
17:48
module is an organized block of code
17:51
with a specific set of capabilities it
17:54
has a specific application domain or a
17:56
workflow like components any angular
17:58
application has at least one module this
18:01
is known as the root module typically an
18:04
angular application has several modules
18:06
the seven building block is routing an
18:09
angular router is responsible for
18:11
interpreting a browser URL as an
18:13
instruction to navigate to a client
18:15
generated view the router is bound to
18:17
links on a page to tell angular to
18:19
navigate the application view when a
18:21
user clicks on it the eighth part is
18:24
services a very broad category a service
18:27
can be anything ranging from a value and
18:29
function to a feature that is required
18:31
by an angular application
18:32
technically a service is a class with a
18:35
well defined
18:36
the last building block is that of a
18:38
template each competence view is
18:40
associated with its companion template a
18:42
template in angular is a form of HTML
18:45
tag that lets angular know that how it
18:47
is meant to render the component our
18:50
next question is explain the differences
18:52
between angular expressions and
18:54
JavaScript expressions so angular
18:57
expressions can contain literals
18:58
operators and variables while JavaScript
19:01
expressions can contain literals
19:02
operators and variables too angular
19:05
expressions can be written inside HTML
19:07
tags while JavaScript expressions cannot
19:09
read written inside HTML tags angular
19:12
does not support conditional loops and
19:14
exceptions and in JavaScript they do
19:17
support conditional loops and exceptions
19:19
angular support has filters file
19:21
javascript has no support for filters
19:24
another question that you might face
19:26
yourself and an angular based interview
19:28
is what is the difference between a
19:30
service function and a factory function
19:32
so used for business layer of the
19:35
application the service function
19:37
operates as a constructor function the
19:39
function is invoked at runtime using the
19:41
new keyword all of the factory function
19:44
works in pretty much the same way as a
19:46
service function does the former is more
19:48
flexible and powerful in actual the
19:51
factory functions of design patterns
19:52
that help in creating objects a next
19:56
question for the day is what is a o o T
19:59
or ahead of time compilation so a or T
20:02
stands for angular ahead of time
20:04
compiler it is used for pre compiling
20:06
the application components along with
20:08
their templates during the build process
20:10
angular applications which are compiled
20:12
with ‰Ùt have a smaller launching time
20:14
also components of these applications
20:17
can execute immediately without needing
20:19
any client-side compilation templates in
20:22
these applications are embedded as
20:23
source within their components it
20:26
reduces the need for downloading the
20:28
angular compiler which in turn saves you
20:30
from a cumbersome task ‰Ùt compiler can
20:32
discard the unused directives which are
20:34
further thrown out using a tree shaking
20:36
tool
20:37
our next question is what is angular
20:39
material so angular material is a UI
20:43
component library angular material helps
20:46
in creating attractive consistent and
20:48
find a fully functional web pages as
20:49
well as web applications it does so
20:52
while following modern web principles
20:54
including browser Portability and
20:55
graceful degradation our next question
20:58
is explain the digest cycle in angular
21:01
so the process of monitoring the watch
21:04
list in order to track changes in the
21:06
value of the watch variable is termed
21:09
the digest cycle in angular the previous
21:12
and present versions of the scope model
21:14
values are compared in each digest cycle
21:16
although the digest cycle process gets
21:18
triggered implicitly
21:19
it is possible to start manually by
21:22
using the apply function the next
21:24
question for the day is explain the
21:26
various types of filters in angular so
21:29
these are the various types of filters
21:30
that you might find in an angular
21:32
application
21:33
the first is currency which formats
21:35
number 2 a currency format the second
21:38
state which formats a date to a
21:39
specified format then is the filter 1
21:42
and this selects a subset of items from
21:44
an array then is JSON to format an
21:47
object with JSON string then is limit to
21:50
limit an array string into a specified
21:51
number of elements or characters then is
21:54
lowercase to format a string to lower
21:56
case then is number to format a number
21:58
to a string then is ordered by that
22:00
orders in array by an expression and
22:02
then is uppercase which formats is
22:04
string to offer case our next question
22:07
is what is ng on in it and how to define
22:10
so ng on in it is a life cycle hook that
22:14
is called
22:14
after angular has finished initializing
22:16
all data bond properties of a directive
22:18
and it is defined as ng on in it and
22:22
then you just open and close the
22:23
brackets and then you can just say void
22:26
if you want our next question for the
22:28
day is what is an sba or single page
22:32
application and can you contrast SPI
22:34
technology with traditional web
22:36
technology so in the SPI technology only
22:39
a single page which is index.html is
22:42
maintained through the URL keeps
22:44
changing unlike the traditional web
22:46
technology SPI technology is faster and
22:49
easy to develop as well
22:51
in the conventional web technology as
22:53
soon as a client requests a web page the
22:55
server sends the resource
22:56
however when again the client requests
22:58
for another page the server responds
23:00
again with sending the requested
23:02
resource the problem with this
23:03
technology is that it requires a lot of
23:05
time a next question is what are angular
23:09
modules so all the angular apps are
23:11
modular and follow a modularity system
23:14
known as ng modules these are the
23:16
containers which hold a cohesive block
23:18
of code dedicated specifically to an
23:21
application domain a workflow or some
23:23
closely related set of capabilities
23:25
these modules generally contain
23:27
components service providers and other
23:29
code files who scope is defined by
23:32
containing ng modules with modules makes
23:35
the code becoming more maintainable
23:36
testable and readable also all the
23:39
dependencies of your application are
23:41
generally defined in modules only so
23:44
this is what a module looks like this is
23:47
your module file as you guys can see it
23:49
has everything that you need out there
23:52
and this is your app dot module or TS
23:55
which has your declaration your imports
23:57
and providers and bootstrap components
24:00
our next question for the day is on
24:03
which type of confidence can we create a
24:06
custom directive so the following types
24:09
of components are used to create a
24:11
custom directive so angle provides
24:13
supports to create custom directives on
24:15
the following first is the element
24:17
directive so directive activates when a
24:20
matching element is encountered another
24:22
one is attribute so directive activates
24:25
when a matching attribute is encountered
24:27
then is a CSS based directive which
24:30
activates when a matching CSS style is
24:32
encountered and another one is a comment
24:34
based directive and this directive
24:37
activates when a matching comment is
24:38
encounter
24:40
next question is what are angular and
24:42
missions so anglers animation systems
24:45
built on CSS functionality in order to
24:47
animate any property that browser
24:49
considers animatable these properties
24:52
include position sizes transforms colors
24:55
borders etc the angular module for
24:57
animations are located in the angular
25:00
slash animation and angular slash
25:02
platform browser and these dependencies
25:04
are automatically added to your project
25:06
when you create a project using the
25:08
angular CLI our next question is what is
25:12
one-way data-binding
25:13
and two-way data-binding and
25:15
differentiate between them so in one-way
25:18
data-binding the view or the UI does not
25:21
update automatically whenever the data
25:23
model changes you need to manually write
25:25
custom code in order to update it every
25:27
time the view changes whereas in two-way
25:29
data-binding the view or the UI part is
25:32
updated implicitly as soon as the data
25:34
model changes it is a synchronization
25:36
process unlike one-way data-binding
25:40
our next question is what are the
25:42
lifecycle hooks for components and
25:44
directors so an angular component has a
25:47
discrete life cycle which contains
25:49
different phases as it transits through
25:51
birth till death in order to gain better
25:54
control of these phases we can hook into
25:56
them using the following so the first is
25:58
constructors it is invoked when a
26:00
confident or directive is created by
26:02
calling new on the class then is ng own
26:06
changes it is invoked whenever there is
26:08
a change or update and any of the input
26:10
properties of the component then there
26:12
is ng on in it it is invoked every time
26:15
a given component is initialized this
26:17
hook is only once called in its lifetime
26:20
after the first ng non changes then is
26:23
ng do check it is invoked whenever the
26:25
change detector off the given component
26:28
is called this allows you to implement
26:29
your own change detection algorithm for
26:32
the provided confident then there is ng
26:34
non destroy it is invoked right before
26:37
the component is destroyed by angular
26:38
you can use this hook in order to
26:40
unsubscribe observables and detach event
26:43
handlers for avoiding any kind of memory
26:45
leaks
26:46
our next question number 32 is what is
26:49
view encapsulation and how many ways are
26:51
there to do it in angular to put it
26:54
simply view encapsulation determines
26:56
whether the style defined in a
26:58
particular confidence will affect the
26:59
entire application or not
27:01
angular supports three types of view
27:03
encapsulation the first is emulated that
27:06
the styles used in other HTML spread to
27:09
the competence then there is native that
27:11
the styles used in other HTML doesn't
27:13
spread to the component and then there
27:15
is none that is style defined in the
27:16
component are visible to all Conference
27:18
of the application our next question is
27:21
the Dom vs. the Bo M so the Dom stands
27:25
for document object model while the Bo M
27:27
stands for browser object model so the
27:30
dome represents a content of a web page
27:32
while the browser works on the level
27:34
above the web page to include browser
27:36
attributes the third is all the objects
27:39
are arranged in this tree structure
27:40
while in a Bo M all global JavaScript
27:43
object variables and functions become
27:45
members of the window object and in a
27:47
Dom w3c recommend standard specification
27:50
and in the Bo M it is an access
27:53
and manipulate browser windows
27:56
our next question is what our template
27:59
expressions a template expression
28:01
produces a value similar to any
28:03
JavaScript expression angular executes
28:06
the expression and assigns it to a
28:07
property of a binding target the target
28:10
might be an HTML element a component or
28:12
a directive in the property binding a
28:14
template expression appears in coach to
28:16
the right of the symbol as in property
28:18
and in interpolation syntax the template
28:21
expression is surrounded by double curly
28:23
braces and this is an example so the
28:27
example out here is username so out here
28:30
the expression is username and it is
28:33
surrounded in double curly braces now
28:36
the next question is what our template
28:38
statements now a template statement
28:42
responds to an event raised by a binding
28:44
target such as an element component or
28:47
directive the template statement appears
28:49
in quotes to the right of the symbol
28:51
like event equals to statement so the
28:54
example out here is edit profile' as a
28:56
template statement
28:59
our next question is what are pipes the
29:03
pipe takes in data as input and
29:05
transforms it to a desired output for
29:08
example let us take a pipe
29:09
transformation to a component or the
29:11
property into a human-friendly date
29:13
using data pipe our next question is
29:16
what is a parameterized pipe now a pipe
29:20
can accept any number of optional
29:22
parameters to fine tune its output the
29:25
parameter is pipe can be created by
29:26
declaring the pipe name with a colon and
29:29
then parameters value if the pipe
29:31
accepts multiple parameters we have to
29:33
separate the values with colons our next
29:36
question is what is the difference
29:38
between pure and impure pipes a pure
29:41
pipe is only called when angular detects
29:43
a change in the value of the parameter
29:44
sparsh to a pipe for example any changes
29:47
to a primitive input value that is a
29:49
string number boolean or a symbol or
29:51
changed object reference and an impure
29:54
pipe is called for every change
29:56
detection cycle no matter whether the
29:58
value of parameter changes that is an
30:00
impure pipe is called often as well as
30:03
every keystroke or mouse move our next
30:06
question is really important and that is
30:08
what is rxjs
30:09
so rxjs is a library for composing
30:12
asynchronous and callback based code in
30:15
a functional reactive style using
30:17
observables many api such as HTTP client
30:20
produce and consume RX genius
30:22
observables and also use operators for
30:24
processing observables our next question
30:27
is what are events in angular so events
30:30
in angular are specific directives that
30:33
help in customizing the behavior of Veda
30:35
storm events few of the angular events
30:38
are ng-click ng copy ng cut ng double
30:41
flick ng key down ng key press mg key up
30:45
ng mouths down ng mouse enter ng Mouse
30:48
leave ng mouse move ng mouse over ng
30:51
mouse up n ng blue
30:54
next question is what is the difference
30:56
between promise and observables so as
30:59
soon as a promise is mean the execution
31:01
takes place however this is not the case
31:03
with observables because they are lazy
31:05
this means that nothing happens until
31:07
the subscription is made while promises
31:09
handle a single event observable is a
31:11
stream that allows passing of more than
31:13
one event the callback is made for each
31:16
event is an observable another question
31:19
related to rxjs that might be asked to
31:21
you is what are the utility functions
31:23
provided by rxjs
31:24
so the rxjs library also provides below
31:27
utility functions for creating and
31:29
working with observables so these are
31:32
converting existing code for
31:33
asynchronous operations into observables
31:36
iterating through the value in a stream
31:38
mapping values to different types
31:40
filtering streams and last but not the
31:42
least composing multiple streams a next
31:45
question is explain how custom elements
31:47
work internally so these are the steps
31:49
in order for custom elements
31:51
functionality traverses app registers
31:54
custom element with browser so use the
31:57
custom create element function to
31:58
convert a component into class that can
32:01
be registered with browser as a custom
32:03
element app adds custom elements to the
32:06
do M and the add custom element just
32:09
like built-in HTML elements directly
32:11
into the do M the third step is browser
32:14
instantiates composed based class so the
32:17
browser creates an instance of the
32:18
registered class and adds it to the dom
32:20
and the last part is instance provides
32:23
content with data binding and change
32:25
detection so the content within the
32:26
template is rendered using the
32:28
components and the dom data a next
32:31
question is what are global angular API
32:34
s so the angular global API is a
32:37
combination of global JavaScript
32:38
functions for performing various common
32:40
tasks like comparing objects iterating
32:42
objects in converting data there are
32:44
some common global angular functions or
32:47
API is like angular that lowercase which
32:49
converts a string to lowercase angular
32:52
dot uppercase which converts the string
32:53
to uppercase angular dot a string that
32:56
returns true if the current reference is
32:58
a string and angular dot is number that
33:00
returns true if the count reference is a
33:02
number
33:03
our next question is related to routing
33:05
and this is what our router events so
33:08
during each navigation the router omits
33:10
navigation events through the router dot
33:12
events property allowing you to track
33:14
the lifecycle of the route the sequence
33:16
of router events is as below the first
33:19
is navigation start then is route config
33:21
load start
33:22
route config load end routes recognized
33:25
guards check start child activation
33:28
start activation start guards check end
33:31
resolve start resolve and activation end
33:34
child activation end navigation in
33:37
navigation cancel navigation arrow and
33:39
scroll
33:41
our next question of the day is what are
33:43
the advantages with ‰Ùt so these are the
33:46
benefits that a OTE come with first one
33:49
is faster entering the browser downloads
33:52
a pre compiled version of the
33:53
application so it can render the
33:54
application immediately without
33:56
compiling the app fewer asynchronous
33:59
requests it in lines internal HTML
34:02
template and CSS stylesheets
34:03
within the application JavaScript which
34:05
eliminates separates a at request then a
34:08
smaller angular framework download size
34:10
that it doesn't require downloading the
34:12
angular compiler hence it dramatically
34:14
reduces application preload detect
34:16
template errors earlier so detects and
34:19
reports templates binding errors during
34:20
the build step itself then there is
34:22
better security and it compiles HTML
34:25
templates and confidence into JavaScript
34:27
so there won't be any injection attacks
34:30
question number 47 is what are the
34:33
restrictions of metadata so in angular
34:36
you must write metadata with the
34:38
following general constraints the first
34:40
is write expression syntax within the
34:43
supported range of JavaScript features
34:44
the second is the compiler can only
34:47
reference symbols which are exported the
34:49
third is only called the function
34:51
supported by the compiler and the fourth
34:53
one is decorated and data bound class
34:55
members must be public question number
34:58
48 is what are the limitations with the
35:00
web worker so you need to remember two
35:03
important things when using web worker
35:04
in angular projects the first one is
35:07
some environments or platform like
35:09
angler / perform server using the
35:11
server-side rendering doesn't support
35:13
web worker in this case you need to
35:15
provide a fallback mechanism to perform
35:17
the computation to work in this
35:18
environment the second is running
35:20
angular in web worker using angular
35:22
platform web worker is not yet supported
35:24
by the angular CLI our second last
35:27
question of the day is explain ng app
35:30
directive in angular
35:31
so ng app directive is used to define
35:33
angular applications which let us use
35:36
Auto bootstrap in an angular application
35:38
it represents the root element of any
35:41
angular application and a generally
35:43
declared HTML or body tag any number of
35:46
ng app directives can be defined within
35:47
an HTML document but just a single
35:50
angular application can be officially
35:52
bootstrap implicitly
35:53
rest of the application must be
35:55
manually bootstrap so for example we
35:57
have the first name in a div out here
36:00
and we have the full name and that is
36:03
how you bootstrap stuff our last
36:05
question of the day is how can you hide
36:08
an HTML element just by a button click
36:10
in angular now an stl element can be
36:13
easily hidden using the ng hide
36:14
directive in conjunction along with a
36:16
controller to hide an element on button
36:19
click so all you have to do is create a
36:21
button that says hide element and in the
36:23
controller you have to write a function
36:25
which is this is dot hide which is false
36:28
and then you just convert that to true
36:30
and this can be done with the NGI
36:32
directive while it is bound to the is
36:35
hide variable so that's it for today
36:38
guys I hope you had fun learning about
36:40
all sorts of angular questions that you
36:42
might face in an interview I hope you
36:44
guys tune in for further angular
36:46
interview questions and videos that's it
36:49
for me for today goodbye I hope you have
36:52
enjoyed listening to this video please
