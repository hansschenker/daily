What are compound components?
------------------------------------------------
When multiple components work together to have a 
- shared implicit state and 
- handle logic together, they are called compound components.

Think of compound components like the 
- <select> and 
----<option> elements in HTML. 

You can click on option and select knows which one was clicked (selectedIndex). 
They work together and so do compound components.
