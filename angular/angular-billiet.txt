Billiet is an arrogant teacher who made me loose 9600.- swiss francs. 

2016 I booked an Angular teaching for 9600.- (Angular 2 was released 2016 in may, 
just when the course started). There was not much Angular Docs around and we had 
to write an Angular 2 project. My project was based on a Angular 
course (https://angular-university.io/course/ngrx-course). 
My code was a 1 to after building of that course). Billiet was supposed to qualify 
the course and his answer was the project is not good enought - I failed the course - 9600.- lost.
At that time nobody had an idea how to test Angular 2 components (no docs, no info) - 
Such a teacher which is not taking into account the context of what is available is 
not a teacher with teaching qualities. Since then on every tweet on every video 
on every article  I will remind him on his teaching qualities!!
