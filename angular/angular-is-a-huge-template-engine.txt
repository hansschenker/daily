A template engine is a specific kind of template processing module that exhibits all of the major 

features of a modern programming language. The term template engine evolved as a 
generalized description of programming languages whose primary 
or exclusive purpose was to process templates and data to output text.

We are now telling Angular to construct a template that relates to some code.

UserController we're going to use to manage this part of the DOM.
