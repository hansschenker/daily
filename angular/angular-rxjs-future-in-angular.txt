I've talked to Alex Rickabaugh and it seems more related to the task of 
- making zone.js optional and propagating changes, as well as 
- async pipe issues, such as introducing null because of inability to predict 
  sync initial value inside a stream and multiple subscriptions with multiple pipes. 

So far it's an early exploration stage where they are thinking of some approach that wraps observables 
(kinda like observables can wrap promises with asObservable) and they plan to have RFCs regarding these ideas. 
I wouldn't worry about RxJS becoming obsolete just yet.
