- with with jQuery the only thing you can do in jQuery is you can monkey patch jQuery so that that call to the jQuery
  can be mocked out but with dependency injection I can actually give you a different instance of xhr and it turns

- angular ships not just with the library that goes through the browser but also with a mocking little tiny

- testability is an important piece of what angular is typically when you get a framework you
