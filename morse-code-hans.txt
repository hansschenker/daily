What is Farnsworth spacing?
Farnsworth Method

slow: > 15 and < 20 words per minute
---------------------------------------
At slow speeds, one should send letters at rates between 15 and 20 words per minute 
and stretch the space between letters and words to produce an overall slower pace of,
strech space between letters and words -> produce less words per minute
-------------------------------------- 
say, 5 WPM. With the faster-sent characters, the student has to recognize the letters by sound.
