When to use it?
This question was several times and basically you can use the SHARI principle to find out if ngrx or redux is needed for your application or even a specific component inside your app.

In it, we introduce the SHARI principle: any state that needs to be Shared, Hydrated, made Available across routes, Retrieved with a side effect, or is Impacted by other components/effects belongs in the Store.

From the docs we get the following:

@ngrx/store (or Redux in general) provides us with a lot of great features and can be used in a lot of use cases. But sometimes this pattern can be an overkill. Implementing it means we get the downside of using Redux (a lot of extra code and complexity) without benefiting of the upsides (predictable state container and unidirectional data flow).

The NgRx core team has come up with a principle called SHARI, that can be used as a rule of thumb on data that needs to be added to the store.

Shared: State that is shared between many components and services
Hydrated: State that needs to be persisted and hydrated across page reloads
Available: State that needs to be available when re-entering routes
Retrieved: State that needs to be retrieved with a side effect, e.g. an HTTP request
Impacted: State that is impacted by other components
Try not to over-engineer your state management layer. Data is often fetched via XHR requests or is being sent over a WebSocket, and therefore is handled on the server side. Always ask yourself when and why to put some data in a client side store and keep alternatives in mind. For example, use routes to reflect applied filters on a list or use a BehaviorSubject in a service if you need to store some simple data, such as settings. Mike Ryan gave a very good talk on this topic: You might not need NgRx

Also, the following question was asked:

Once you add ngrx to an application, is it a bad practice to use a service with BehaviorSubject to communicate between components? Example. Having a modal with a form that uses a stepper. Should the modal use NGRX because the whole app is using ngrx.

The response from Mike was:

No, you do not have to use ngrx for all your states.

We have this term called SHARI principle and essentially the only state that goes into the ngrx store is a truly global state, state that is shared between your components, state that needs to be rehydrated when the application boots up or is impacted by actions of other features.

If the state doesn't match that rubric, then it is totally fine to use a simple state storage mechanism for it as a service with a Behavior Subject.

Another related comment by Alex:

One of the things I remember myself when I started using ngrx, I tried to push anything ngrx mostly because I wanted the dev tools to the time travel and I think some of the features that are exciting and helpful can misguide you. The moment of realization for me is not to push everything possible into it, at that time we were learning, as the pattern was evolving, now is kind of known what are the best practices.

Some of the things I don't put in the store are Form Controls (since it is already a reactive state), the local state within components (even if it interacts with the network), some of the lifecycle state for a component. Basically, the first thing I asked myself is how shareable is the state, how much does the application needs to know about this.

Here is a link to a re-usable service that uses BehaviorSubject and can be used for simpler communication cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BehaviorSubject
----------------
Angular service to handle state using BehaviorSubject

Created an abstract service to keep state and handle communication between components and services.

The service uses the BehaviorSubject from RxJS, and have some nice features like auto-completion and being able to get either a snapshot or an observable with the value.

How to use it?
Create a new service extending the PlainStoreService and passing the model of the state.
// Service
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class UserEditStore extends PlainStoreService<UserEditState> {

   constructor() {
      super();
      const initialState: UserEditState = {
         user:null,
         isLoading: false,
         isDirty: false,
         isSaving: false
      };
      this.state = new BehaviorSubject<UserEditState>(initialState);
   }
}
Now, you will be able to inject the service wherever is needed and use it.

The service has the following methods:

select - Returns an observable for a property on the store.
selectSnapshot - Gets the current state of a property
set - Set a new value for a single property
setState - Sets values for multiple properties on the store
Here is the service:
import { BehaviorSubject, Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { pluck } from 'rxjs/operators';

/**
 * Plain Store Service.
 * This is intended to be used to enable communication between components
 * and it should be just in cases where there are not too many states shared between them.
 */
export class PlainStoreService<T> {

    protected state: BehaviorSubject<T>;

    constructor() {
    }

    /**
     * Returns an observable for a property on the store.
     * This is used when the consumer needs the stream of changes
     * for the property observed.
     *
     * @param key - the key of the property to be retrieved
     */
    public select<K extends keyof T>(key: K): Observable<T[K]> {
        return this.state.asObservable().pipe(pluck(key));
    }

    /**
     * Gets the current state of a property.
     * This is used when the consumer needs just the current state
     *
     * @param key - the key of the property to be retrieved
     */
    public selectSnapshot<K extends keyof T>(key: K): T[K] {
        return this.state.getValue()[key];
    }

    /**
     * This is used to set a new value for a property
     *
     * @param key - the key of the property to be retrieved
     * @param data - the new data to be saved
     */
    public set<K extends keyof T>(key: K, data: T[K]) {
        this.state.next({ ...this.state.value, [key]: data });
    }

    /**
     * Sets values for multiple properties on the store
     * This is used when there is a need to update multiple properties in the store
     *
     * @param partialState - the partial state that includes the new values to be saved
     */
    public setState(partialState: Partial<T>): void {

        const currentState = this.state.getValue();
        const nextState = Object.assign({}, currentState, partialState);

        this.state.next(nextState);
    }

}

Here is the testing file for the service:
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
import { PlainStoreService } from './plain-store.service';

class MockedStore {
  name: string;
  isEnabled: boolean;
}

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
class MockedStoreService extends PlainStoreService<MockedStore> {

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = new BehaviorSubject<MockedStore>(
      {
        name: 'test',
        isEnabled: false
      });
  }
}

describe('PlainStoreService', () => {

  const service = new MockedStoreService();

  it('can load instance', () => {
    expect(service).toBeTruthy();
  });

  describe('select', () => {

    it('should return an observable with the value of the provided key', (done) => {
      service.select('name').subscribe((name) => {
        expect(name).toEqual('test');
        done();
      });
    });

  });

  describe('selectSnapshot', () => {

    it('should return the value of the provided key', () => {
      const name = service.selectSnapshot('name');
      expect(name).toEqual('test');
    });

  });

  describe('set', () => {
    it('should set a new value for a key', () => {
      const newName = 'newValue';

      service.set('name', newName);

      const name = service.selectSnapshot('name');
      expect(name).toEqual(newName);
    });
  });

  describe('setState', () => {
    it('should set a new value for the whole state', () => {
      const newName = 'newValue';
      const newIsEnabled = true;

      service.setState(
        {
          name: newName,
          isEnabled: newIsEnabled
        });

      const name = service.selectSnapshot('name');
      const isEnabled = service.selectSnapshot('isEnabled');

      expect(name).toEqual(newName);
      expect(isEnabled).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });
});

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions
----------
Unified interface to describe events
Just data, no functionality
Has at a minimum a type property
Strongly typed using classes and enums
Notes
There are a few rules to writing good actions within your application.

Upfront - write actions before developing features to understand and gain a shared knowledge of the feature being implemented.
Divide - categorize actions based on the event source.
Many - actions are inexpensive to write, so the more actions you write, the better you express flows in your application.
Event-Driven - capture events not commands as you are separating the description of an event and the handling of that event.
Descriptive - provide context that are targeted to a unique event with more detailed information you can use to aid in debugging with the developer tools.

Actions can be created with props or fat arrows
// With props
export const updateBook = createAction(
    '[Books Page] Update a book',
    props<{
        book: BookRequiredProps,
        bookId: string
    }>()
);

// With fat arrow
export const getAuthStatusSuccess = createAction(
    "[Auth/API] Get Auth Status Success",
    (user: UserModel | null) => ({user})
);
Event Storming
You can use sticky notes as a group to identify:

All of the events in the system
The commands that cause the event to arise
The actor in the system that invokes the command
The data models attached to each event
Naming Actions
The category of the action is captured within the square brackets []
It is recommended to use present or past tense to describe the event occurred and stick with it.
Example

When related to components you can use present tense because they are related to events. It is like in HTML the events do not use past tense. Eg. OnClick or click is not OnClicked or clicked
  export const createBook = createAction(
      '[Books Page] Create a book',
      props<{book: BookRequiredProps}>()
  );

  export const selectBook = createAction(
      '[Books Page] Select a book',
      props<{bookId: string}>()
  );
When the actions are related to API you can use past tense because they are used to describe an action that happened
export const bookUpdated = createAction(
    '[Books API] Book Updated Success',
    props<{book: BookModel}>()
);

export const bookDeleted = createAction(
   '[Books API] Book Deleted Success',
   props<{bookId: string}>()
);
Folders and File structure
It is a good practice to have the actions define close to the feature that uses them.
+- books\
¦     actions\
¦         books-api.actions.ts
¦         books-page.actions.ts
¦         index.ts      
The index file can be used to define the names for the actions exported, but it can be completely avoided
import * as BooksPageActions from "./books-page.actions";
import * as BooksApiActions from "./books-api.actions";

export { BooksPageActions, BooksApiActions };

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reducers
---------------
Produce new states
Receive the last state and next action
Switch on the action type
Use pure, immutable operations
Notes
Create separate reducer per feature
Should live outside the feature because the state it is shared in the whole application
State should save the model as it comes from the API. This can be later transformed into the selectors.
Combine actions that can use the same reducer
  on(BooksPageActions.enter, BooksPageActions.clearSelectedBook, (state, action) => ({
          ...state,
          activeBookId: null
   })),
Only reducers can modify state and it should do it in an immutable way
Create helper functions to handle the data manipulation of collections.
Example
const createBook = (books: BookModel[], book: BookModel) => [...books, book];
const updateBook = (books: BookModel[], changes: BookModel) =>
    books.map(book => {
        return book.id === changes.id ? Object.assign({}, book, changes) : book;
    });
const deleteBook = (books: BookModel[], bookId: string) =>
    books.filter(book => bookId !== book.id);

...

    on(BooksApiActions.bookCreated, (state, action) => {
        return {
            collection: createBook(state.collection, action.book),
            activeBookId: null
        };
    }),
    on(BooksApiActions.bookUpdated, (state, action) => {
        return {
            collection: updateBook(state.collection, action.book),
            activeBookId: null
        };
    }),
    on(BooksApiActions.bookDeleted, (state, action) => {
        return {
            ...state,
            collection: deleteBook(state.collection, action.bookId)
        };
    })
Feature reducer file
Declares a State interface with the state for the feature
Declares an initialState that included the initial state
Declare a feature reducer that contains the result of using createReducer
Exports a reducer function that wraps the reducer created. This is needed for AOT and it is not needed when using Ivy.
Example
export interface State {
    collection: BookModel[];
    activeBookId: string | null;
}

export const initialState: State = {
    collection: [],
    activeBookId: null
};

export const booksReducer = createReducer(
    initialState,
    on(BooksPageActions.enter,
        BooksPageActions.clearSelectedBook, (state, action) => ({
        ...state,
        activeBookId: null
    })),
    on(BooksPageActions.selectBook, (state, action) => ({
        ...state,
        activeBookId: action.bookId
    })),
);

export function reducer(state: State | undefined, action: Action) {
    return booksReducer(state, action);
}

The index file defines the state and assigns each reducer to a property on the state
import * as fromBooks from "./books.reducer";

export interface State {
    books: fromBooks.State;
}

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<State> = {
    books:fromBooks.reducer
};

export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<State>[] = [];

Selectors
-------------
Allow us to query our store for data
Recompute when their inputs change
Fully leverage memoization for performance
Selectors are fully composable
Notes
They are in charge of transforming the data to how the UI uses it. State in the store should be clean and easy to serialize and since selector is easy to test this is the best place to transform. Is also makes it easier to hydrate
They can transform to complete "View Models", there is nothing wrong about naming the model specific to the UI that they are using
"Getter" selectors are simple selector that get data from a property on the state
export const selectAll = (state: State) => state.collection;
export const selectActiveBookId = (state: State) => state.activeBookId;
Complex selectors combine selectors and this should be created using createSelector. The function only gets called if any of the inputs selectors are modified
export const selectActiveBook = createSelector(
    selectAll,
    selectActiveBookId,
    (books, activeBookId) =>
        books.find(book => book.id === activeBookId)
);
Selectors can go next to the component where they are used or in the reducer file located in the state folder. Local selectors make it easier to test

Global selectors are added in the state/index.
export const selectBooksState = (state:State)=> state.books;
export const selectActiveBook = createSelector(
    selectBooksState,
    fromBooks.selectActiveBook
)
When using the selector in the component is recommended to initialize in the constructor. If using the strict mode in TypeScript, the compiler will not be able to know that the selectors where initialized on ngOnInit

----------------------------------------------------------------
Effects
----------------
Processes that run in the background
Connect your app to the outside world
Often used to talk to services
Written entirely using RxJS streams
Notes
Try to keep effect close to the reducer and group them in classes as it seems convenient
For effects, it's okay to split them into separate effects files, one for each API service. But it's not a mandate
Is still possible to use guards and resolver, just dispatch an action when it is done
It is recommended to not use resolvers since we can dispatch the actions using effects
Put the books-api.effects file in the same level as books.module.ts, so that the bootstrapping is done at this level and effects are loaded and running if and only if the books page is loaded. If we were to put the effects in the shared global states, the effects would be running and listening at all times, which is not the desired behavior.
An effect should dispatch a single action, use a reducer to modify state if multiple props of the state need to be modified
Prefer the use of brackets and return statements in arrow function to increase debugability
// Prefer this
getAllBooks$ = createEffect(() => {
    return this.actions$.pipe(
        ofType(BooksPageActions.enter),
        mergeMap((action) => {
            return this.booksService
                .all()
                .pipe(
                    map((books: any) => BooksApiActions.booksLoaded({books}))
                )
        })
    );
})

// Instead of 
 getAllBooks$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
       ofType(BooksPageActions.enter),
       mergeMap((action) =>
           this.booksService
               .all()
               .pipe(
                   map((books: any) => BooksApiActions.booksLoaded({books}))
               ))
    ))

What map operator should I use?
switchMap is not always the best solution for all the effects and here are other operators we can use.

mergeMap Subscribe immediately, never cancel or discard. It can have race conditions.
This can be used to Delete items, because it is probably safe to delete the items without caring about the deletion order
deleteBook$ = createEffect(() =>
        this.actions$.pipe(
            ofType(BooksPageActions.deleteBook),
            mergeMap(action =>
                this.booksService
                    .delete(action.bookId)
                    .pipe(
                        map(() => BooksApiActions.bookDeleted({bookId: action.bookId}))
                    )
            )
        )
    );
concatMap Subscribe after the last one finishes
This can be used for updating or creating items, because it matters in what order the item is updated or created.
createBook$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
        ofType(BooksPageActions.createBook),
        concatMap(action =>
            this.booksService
                .create(action.book)
                .pipe(map(book => BooksApiActions.bookCreated({book})))
        )
    )
);
exhaustMap Discard until the last one finishes. Can have race conditions
This can be used for non-parameterized queries. It does only one request event if it gets called multiple times. Eg. getting all books.
getAllBooks$ = createEffect(() => {
    return this.actions$.pipe(
        ofType(BooksPageActions.enter),
        exhaustMap((action) => {
            return this.booksService
                .all()
                .pipe(
                    map((books: any) => BooksApiActions.booksLoaded({books}))
                )
        })
    )
})
switchMap Cancel the last one if it has not completed. Can have race conditions
This can be used for parameterized queries

Other effects examples
Effects does not have to start with an action
@Effect() tick$ = interval(/* Every minute */ 60 * 1000).pipe(
 map(() => Clock.tickAction(new Date()))
);
Effects can be used to elegantly connect to a WebSocket
@Effect()
ws$ = fromWebSocket("/ws").pipe(map(message => {
  switch (message.kind) {
    case “book_created”: {
      return WebSocketActions.bookCreated(message.book);
    }
    case “book_updated”: {
      return WebSocketActions.bookUpdated(message.book);
    }
    case “book_deleted”: {
      return WebSocketActions.bookDeleted(message.book);
     }
}}))
You can use an effect to communicate to any API/Library that returns observables. The following example shows this by communicating with the snack bar notification API.
@Effect() promptToRetry$ = this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(BooksApiActions.createFailure),
 mergeMap(action =>
    this.snackBar
        .open("Failed to save book.","Try Again", {duration: /* 12 seconds */ 12 * 1000 })
        .onAction()
        .pipe(
          map(() => BooksApiActions.retryCreate(action.book))
        )
   )
);
Effects can be used to retry API Calls
@Effect()
createBook$ = this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(
    BooksPageActions.createBook,
    BooksApiActions.retryCreate,
 ),
 mergeMap(action =>
   this.booksService.create(action.book).pipe(
     map(book => BooksApiActions.bookCreated({ book })),
     catchError(error => of(BooksApiActions.createFailure({
       error,
       book: action.book,
     })))
 )));
It is OK to write effects that don't dispatch any action like the following example shows how it is used to open a modal
@Effect({ dispatch: false })
openUploadModal$ = this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(BooksPageActions.openUploadModal),
 tap(() => {
    this.dialog.open(BooksCoverUploadModalComponent);
 })
);
An effect can be used to handle a cancelation like the following example that shows how an upload is cancelled
@Effect() uploadCover$ = this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(BooksPageActions.uploadCover),
 concatMap(action =>
    this.booksService.uploadCover(action.cover).pipe(
      map(result => BooksApiActions.uploadComplete(result)),
      takeUntil(
        this.actions$.pipe(
          ofType(BooksPageActions.cancelUpload)
        )
))));

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entities
----------------
Working with collections should be fast
Collections are very common
@ngrx/entity provides a common set of basic operations
@ngrx/entity provides a common set of basic state derivations
How to add @ngrx/entity
Start by creating a state that extends the entityState
// From:

// export interface State {
//     collection: BookModel[];
//     activeBookId: string | null;
// }


// To:
export interface State extends EntityState<BookModel> {

    activeBookId: string | null;
}
Create an adapter and define the initial state with it.
Note that the collection is no longer needed
// From:

// export const initialState: State = {
//     collection: [],
//     activeBookId: null
// };

// To:
const adapter = createEntityAdapter<BookModel>();

export const initialState: State = adapter.getInitialState({
    activeBookId: null
});
Out of the box, it uses the 'id' as the id, but we can also specify custom id and comparer.
const adapter = createEntityAdapter<BookModel>({
    selectId: (model: BookModel) => model.name,
    sortComparer:(a:BookModel,b:BookModel)=> a.name.localeCompare(b.name)
});
Refactor the reducers to use the entity adapter
    // on(BooksApiActions.bookCreated, (state, action) => {
    //     return {
    //         collection: createBook(state.collection, action.book),
    //         activeBookId: null
    //     };
    // }),
    on(BooksApiActions.bookCreated, (state, action) => {
        return adapter.addOne(action.book, {
            ...state,
            activeBookId: null
        })
    }),

    // on(BooksApiActions.bookUpdated, (state, action) => {
    //     return {
    //         collection: updateBook(state.collection, action.book),
    //         activeBookId: null
    //     };
    // }),
    on(BooksApiActions.bookUpdated, (state, action) => {
        return adapter.updateOne(
            {id: action.book.id, changes: action.book},
            {
                ...state,
                activeBookId: null
            })
    }),

    // on(BooksApiActions.bookDeleted, (state, action) => {
    //     return {
    //         ...state,
    //         collection: deleteBook(state.collection, action.bookId)
    //     };
    // })
    on(BooksApiActions.bookDeleted, (state, action) => {
        return adapter.removeOne(action.bookId, state)
    })
Then create selectors using the entity adapter
// From:
// export const selectAll = (state: State) => state.collection;
// export const selectActiveBookId = (state: State) => state.activeBookId;
// export const selectActiveBook = createSelector(
//     selectAll,
//     selectActiveBookId,
//     (books, activeBookId) => books.find(book => book.id === activeBookId) || null
// );

// To:
export const {selectAll, selectEntities} = adapter.getSelectors();
export const selectActiveBookId = (state: State) => state.activeBookId;
Adapter Collection Methods
The entity adapter also provides methods for operations against an entity. These methods can change one or many records at a time. Each method returns the newly modified state if changes were made and the same state if no changes were made.

addOne: Add one entity to the collection
addMany: Add multiple entities to the collection
addAll: Replace current collection with provided collection
setOne: Add or Replace one entity in the collection
removeOne: Remove one entity from the collection
removeMany: Remove multiple entities from the collection, by id or by predicate
removeAll: Clear entity collection
updateOne: Update one entity in the collection
updateMany: Update multiple entities in the collection
upsertOne: Add or Update one entity in the collection
upsertMany: Add or Update multiple entities in the collection
map: Update multiple entities in the collection by defining a map function, similar to Array.map

MetaReducers . or Reducer Interceptors - State interceptors
----------------------------------------
Intercept actions before they are reduced
Intercept state before it is emitted
Can change the control flow of the Store
Alt Text

Most common use cases
Reset state when a signout action occurs
for debugging creating logger
to rehydrate when the application starts up
-It is like a plugin system for the store, they behave similarly to the interceptors

Example
An example of this can be to use it in a logger
const logger = (reducer: ActionReducer<any, any>) => (state: any, action: Action) => {
    console.log('Previous State', state);
    console.log('Action', action);

    const nextState = reducer(state, action);

    console.log('Next State', nextState);
    return nextState;
};

export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<State>[] = [logger];

Project Structure - Folder Structure
------------------------------------
Following the LIFT principle:

Locating our code is easy
Identify code at a glance
Flat file structure for as long as possible
Try to stay DRY - don’t repeat yourself
Key Takeaways
Put state in a shared place separate from features
Effects, components, and actions belong to features
Some effects can be shared
Reducers reach into modules’ action barrels
Folder structure followed in the workshop
+- books\
¦     actions\
¦         books-api.actions.ts
¦         books-page.actions.ts
¦         index.ts                  // Includes creating names for the exports
¦      books-api.effects.ts
¦     
+- shared\
¦       state\
¦          {feature}.reducer.ts     // Includes state interface, initial interface, reducers and local selectors
¦          index.ts
¦ 
The index file in the actions folder was using action barrels like the following:
import * as BooksPageActions from "./books-page.actions";
import * as BooksApiActions from "./books-api.actions";

export { BooksPageActions, BooksApiActions };
This made easier and more readable at the time of importing it:
import { BooksPageActions } from "app/modules/book-collection/actions";
Folder structure followed in example app from @ngrx

¦     actions\
¦         books-api.actions.ts

|         index.ts 
¦     
+- reducers\
¦        index.ts  /// Defines the root state and reducers
¦ 
The index file under the reducers folder is in charge of setting up the reducer and state
import * as fromSearch from '@example-app/books/reducers/search.reducer';
import * as fromBooks from '@example-app/books/reducers/books.reducer';
import * as fromCollection from '@example-app/books/reducers/collection.reducer';
import * as fromRoot from '@example-app/reducers';

export const booksFeatureKey = 'books';

export interface BooksState {
  [fromSearch.searchFeatureKey]: fromSearch.State;
  [fromBooks.booksFeatureKey]: fromBooks.State;
  [fromCollection.collectionFeatureKey]: fromCollection.State;
}

export interface State extends fromRoot.State {
  [booksFeatureKey]: BooksState;
}

/** Provide reducer in AoT-compilation happy way */
export function reducers(state: BooksState | undefined, action: Action) {
  return combineReducers({
    [fromSearch.searchFeatureKey]: fromSearch.reducer,
    [fromBooks.booksFeatureKey]: fromBooks.reducer,
    [fromCollection.collectionFeatureKey]: fromCollection.reducer,
  })(state, action);
}
The index file under app/reducers/index.ts defines the meta-reducers, root state, and reducers
/**
 * Our state is composed of a map of action reducer functions.
 * These reducer functions are called with each dispatched action
 * and the current or initial state and return a new immutable state.
 */
export const ROOT_REDUCERS = new InjectionToken<
  ActionReducerMap<State, Action>
>('Root reducers token', {
  factory: () => ({
    [fromLayout.layoutFeatureKey]: fromLayout.reducer,
    router: fromRouter.routerReducer,
  }),
});
Personally, I like how the example-app is organized. One of the things that I will add is to have all the folders related to ngrx in a single folder:
+- books\
¦     store\
¦        actions\
¦            books-api.actions.ts
¦            books-page.actions.ts
¦            index.ts                  // Includes creating names for the exports
¦        effects\
|            books.effects.spec.ts 
|            books.effects.ts 
|        models\
|            books.ts 
¦        reducers\
|            books.reducer.spec.ts 
|            books.reducer.ts 
|            collection.reducer.ts
