Workshop, 5×2.5h + Q&A • Thu & Fri, July 8–22 2021
09:00 – 11:30 am pt (Pacific, US) • 18:00 – 20:30 cet (Europe)

Modern CSS has increased and improved the available CSS properties and layout behaviors, with modern browsers nearly in-sync for critical feature support. But — if you haven’t looked into CSS in a while, or have typically relied on frameworks to do the heavy lifting, it can seem overwhelming to figure out how to level-up your CSS skills!

Throughout this workshop, we’ll create our own CSS framework in order to learn about what modern CSS has to offer us.

You’ll take away a reference for common layout patterns, and create flexible, extendable samples of high-touch user interface components. Everything we cover will be practical examples that leverage modern CSS to upgrade them from older solutions. All styles created will have support across the major modern browsers so you can immediately use them in your current projects.

This workshop will also emphasize creating accessible styles, and we’ll discuss what that means and learn how to test for compliance.

How to ensure your styles and components are accessible not just today, but also as your styles grow.
To do a lot with a little for ultimate performance thanks to modern CSS allowing us to create intrinsically responsive layouts with minimal properties.
A modern toolchain as we use Eleventy as our static site generator (an upgrade/replacement for tools like Gulp), Sass to provide additional styling flexibility, stylelint for CSS linting, and a few others to help make our styles production ready!
The “why” behind each styling decision to help you take your new knowledge beyond the workshop and be prepared to tackle future CSS challenges, including debugging and making scalable style decisions.
