Bloodwork or blood work is a term for a blood test or a group of blood tests. Blood tests can be used to diagnose diseases, infections, or deficiencies of blood components. Bloodwork can also measure the levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and other markers for health risks¹²⁵. 

It is true that bloodwork can provide valuable information about an individual's health status. Blood tests are used to measure or examine cells, chemicals, proteins, or other substances in the blood. Blood testing is one of the most common types of lab tests and is often included as part of a regular checkup².

Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. The triglycerides are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. If you regularly eat more calories than you burn, particularly "easy" calories like carbohydrates and fats, you may have high triglycerides.

The most widely studied classes of lipid metabolite biomarkers in cardiovascular disease are phospholipids, sphingolipids/ceramides, glycolipids, cholesterol esters, fatty acids, and acylcarnitines¹. A complete cholesterol test — also called a lipid panel or lipid profile — is a blood test that can measure the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood². Standard lipid testing, represented by total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides, is a well-established platform for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction and management³.

Yes, the number of white blood cells can play a role in inflammation. When there is inflammation in the body, there will be higher levels of substances known as biomarkers. An example of a biomarker is C-reactive protein (CRP). If a doctor wants to test for inflammation, they may assess CRP levels..
	
Biomarkers of aging are indicators that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than chronological age. Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to extend lifespan. Some well-accepted biomarkers of longevity include body mass index, vitamin D, blood pressure, resting heart rate, and chronic inflammation¹. Glucose, insulin and triglycerides are also biomarkers of healthy ageing². To understand the differences between the “healthy aging” and “unhealthy aging”, evaluate the effects of the many lifestyle choices and a variety of emerging longevity interventions, it is essential to be able to track the rate of aging and develop a comprehensive set of aging biomarkers³.

Regular exercise plays a significant role in living longer. It can slow the aging process, increase life expectancy and partially reverse the effects of the aging process on physiological functions and preserve functional reserve in the elderly¹³⁶. Cardiovascular health is a primary determinant of overall health and longevity, and exercise plays a significant role in it. Regular physical activity strengthens the heart, reduces resting heart rate, and improves blood circulation². Current guidelines recommend 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity (walking, running, swimming, biking), or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, or a mix of both⁴. Even small increases in daily exercise are tied to longevity⁵.

Yes, strength training is important for healthy aging and longevity. Resistance training can counteract the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) which is characterized by a decrease in contractile protein and excessive intra-an extracellular lipid accumulation². People who do strength training live longer and better. Cardio plus strength training offers the most protection¹⁴. Incorporating strength training into your routine can aid in weight loss or weight maintenance, contributing to overall longevity³⁵.

Strength training for people over 60 can help prevent osteoporosis, falls, and loss of muscle and bone mass. It can also reverse the trend of bone loss and increase strength in major muscle groups. Women over 60 should work with a personal trainer who specializes in older populations and active aging to develop an exercise program that suits their health needs and limitations. They should also do a variety of exercises that work against resistance, such as leg press, chest press, lat pulldown, leg curl, abdominals, pushups, wrist curls, arm curls, weighted squat, bench press, squat jumps, lunge jumps, deadlifts, single-leg deadlifts, bentover rows, and step-ups¹. If you're in your 60s, you can absolutely lift weights or work on other kinds of strength-training exercises. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all adults, no matter their age, do muscle-strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week³.

Yes, isometric training can also help improve strength and muscle mass. Isometric exercises are those that involve holding a position without moving, such as planks or wall sits. They can be a great way to build strength without putting too much stress on your joints.

Here are some isometric exercises that you can try:

- Planks: Planks are a classic core exercise. You can start with a basic plank by getting into a push-up position and holding it for as long as you can. As you get stronger, you can try different variations of the plank.

- Isometric bench press: Perform a regular bench press, but with much lighter weight. Hold the bar at the bottom of the movement for 10 seconds before pushing it back up.

- Isometric squat: Using a barbell or dumbbells, perform a squat, hold the bottom position (or a sticking point you have) for 2 to 3 seconds.

- Isometric pull-ups: One of the best ways to increase your ability to do pull-ups is to train them isometrically. You can do this by holding yourself at the top of the pull-up position for as long as you can.

These exercises are excellent for building strength and muscle mass¹. However, it's important to note that isometric exercises should be done in addition to other types of exercise, such as aerobic exercise and resistance training².
