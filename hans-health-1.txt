the oil we would measure how many how many times they could go whatever they were doing and then we would put them on
37:53
oil at a tablespoon per 50 mixed in food spread out over the course of the day at
37:58
the end of the month we had them work to exhaustion again and on average their
38:04
increase in performance was 40 to 60% that's huge
38:09
there's no training program on the planet that gets you that kind of that kind of benefit and was just by getting
38:17
something that 99% of the population is not getting enough of now why is that
38:22
well the oils are increase there you know they go rancid I said they spoil
38:28
they react with oxygen and they spoil they go rancid right so they're very sensitive to oxygen and one of the ways
38:36
in the ARCA the structural architecture of the body in the biochemical architecture they have a way of bringing
38:44
more oxygen in and metabolizing it more effectively so anything that increases
38:51
your oxygen metabolism will mean that it takes you longer to get tired and
38:58
because you get tired from lactic acid buildup which requires oxygen to break down you will also recover quicker if
39:06
you take something that increases your oxygen ableism and that's what we found they
39:11
said their injuries healed in a third of the third to half the time that the
39:17
recovery was about half as long and then they could go again and they could go longer without you know before they got
39:26
tired we at that time everybody was on high carb low fat diets that started in
39:32
1979 with the McGovern report should eat more carbs so they got put on the base
39:37
of the food pyramid and they put the oils on top and said eat less of them they should have talked about the


miles then you hit the wall and then for their other six miles you're dragging your butt and we said no no you're doing
41:58
it wrong nobody was doing this we just said hey you guys are doing it wrong you know and you said you're doing that
42:04
wrong what you need to do is you need to carb deplete and make sure that by the
42:09
time you start your race your fat burning' is turned on because you've got no carbs to burn because it takes time
42:16
to make the switch from from car burning to fat burning and not everybody
42:22
followed it but the ones who did they came back after and they said and I was amazing
42:27
after I finished running my marathon I felt like I had the energy to run another one excuse me total change just
42:34
by doing it backwards not backwards okay
42:40
digestion they are happy happy partners
42:45
with probiotics you how many of you know how hot probiotics are these days okay
42:53
probiotics are a big deal right now they're they're the wave and that what are what are probiotics well they're
43:00
bacteria in your digestive tract there are about a thousand different kinds of bacteria in your digestive tract and
43:07
altogether they have a hundred times more genes than you have in all of your
43:12
cells you got 23,000 to do all the things to put the body together and they've got 2.3 million and they make
43:21
different things there are some bacteria that make bad stuff and when that gets
43:26
into your body that has effects on your health and you have good bacteria that make positive
43:31
molecules when you get them in your body they are beneficial to your health and
43:39
where do they come from in nature they came from foods so if say
43:45
if an animal or even a cow in the meadow if it was eating grass you know when I
43:51
was a kid we lived on a farm and the cows had really sweet smelling breath I didn't smell like grass it smelled
43:58
sweeter than that and I never gave it much thought until I started working with probiotics and I've remembered why
44:06
because the probiotics were on the grass every mouthful of grass they got
44:11
probiotics and Neera in their mouth and then they worked their way through the entire digestive tract and was
44:17
helpful to the health of the digestive tract and the health of the cow what we
44:23
do is we swallow capsules because they come in capsules if you do that then you
44:29
get benefits from here down but not from here up so suppose you eat food
44:35
contaminated with salmonella put it in here Salmonella in here goes down your
44:40
tube and you go on the toilet right and so what so you take probiotics swallow a
44:47
capsule clean it up from here get reinfected from here so what I recommend
44:53
people do they come in capsules the one I use is called you call Super eight
44:59
we call it bifida plus super bifida plus you open a capsule in your mouth brush
45:05
your teeth with it before you go to bed make sure it goes in all the places
45:11
where bacteria can go then swallow it don't rinse your mouth go to bed with
45:16
your mouth full of probiotics why is that because how many of you know that
45:22
the worst breath is always in the morning when you get up everybody knows right well most people don't even want
45:29
to say right but you say excuse 

feel like oh my god I have the most incredible life that any human being has ever been given then you want to stick
1:17:59
around as long as you can and then you'll do whatever it is that you need to do to be able to stick around as long
1:18:07
as you can and when you're inspired you you you move out of your mental ruts that keep you in the hole and make the
1:18:14
changes much easier so I began to think that just as much as good information is
1:18:20
that you've got to do something in some way you to inspire people whether that's with funny or whether that's with well first
1:18:27
of all you got to be inspired yourself I think everything else becomes easier if
1:18:33
you're inspired yourself and so then I started thinking about what else affects health there isn't anything that doesn't
1:18:39
affect health everything affects else whether it's American politics or you
1:18:48
know or what we do to the environment or the kind of people we hang around with
1:18:54
or the kind of people how we treat them
1:19:03
a lot of people take here how connected
1:19:10
we are to life energy there's life energy if you could be if you could be
1:19:16
life energy and not just the body then actually you would never be the
1:19:21
president all right energy cannot get depressed and energy never gets sick and
1:19:30
when you're when your life is light and if I ask you whose body is that most of you will say this is my body right and
1:19:37
in saying that this is my body you have already said I am NOT the body I am the
1:19:43
owner of the body well who is the owner of the body while life owns your body and when life decides to go elsewhere
1:19:51
your body is finished and then are you go staying with the body or are you
1:19:57
going with life and that is a question you can only answer by your own experience and to do that you have to
1:20:03
sit still and just be with yourself and you discover when you do that that the
1:20:11
more you do the smaller you get and when you be you become everything because in
1:20:18
behind that energy is an awareness that's even deeper and all of that
1:20:23
affects health so if you're not in touch with the life you are then you're always
1:20:29
trying to you know trying to fix the body oh my god I got this oh my
1:20:35
I got that you don't get the healing that comes from something in you that
1:20:41
never gets sick so you've taken out one huge healing factor and then as you get
1:20:48
older and older it gets worse and worse because you know I'm 76 and what if you
1:21:01
could live your life fully present in all of your being which includes the awareness which includes the energy
1:21:08
which includes your inspiration that is just the shine of the energy which includes your body food and fitness and
1:21:16
water and air your survival skills or
1:21:22
preemptively creating safety in your in your environment and the people you're
1:21:29
around and what you would you do to make them supportive and your environment
1:21:36
what if you were present to all of that the only place you wouldn't be is in
1:21:42
your head in your random thoughts in your negativity in all the things people
1:21:48
told you about you that you weren't good enough or that there was something wrong with you if you were if you could live
1:21:55
your life that way it wouldn't be a lot of sickness and and when you live like
1:22:01
that you make you make choices and you make them pretty easily to go fresh
1:22:07
whole raw organic to go fresh whole raw organic most mostly plant-based Whole
1:22:14
Foods with the vitamin b2 supplement that's what the research says want the longest life and the best health that's
1:22:22
how you do
1:22:33
yeah and what if 8 billion people lived that way we wouldn't have any Wars
1:22:40
that's my goal my goal is 8 billion people live their lives lit up from within because the lights already there
1:22:45
it's just a matter of looking into it instead of looking away from it when we do that we feel so taken care of because
1:22:52
life has taken perfect care of us through all our dramas and all the traumas I'm a second world war baby out
1:22:58
of Poland the adjournment but here in Poland and the Communists were chasing
1:23:04
us in tanks and trucks and the Allies were shooting us from planes probably some people from Britain they're flyers
1:23:10
from Britain anyway I was 2 2 not 3 yet I just remember the fear and the anxiety
1:23:17
of it and part of the reason I went to science and then bio and then psyche and
1:23:23
self was because I couldn't depend on anything I didn't know what I could
1:23:28
depend on my mother left me behind because she could hand it couldn't
1:23:33
handle six kids and it was cheap it was safer to go through the fields than on
1:23:39
the roads because the roads is worthy yeah so we're back in the front were not
1:23:45
safe and what part of my development was
1:23:51
that I had lots of you know what would he expect I came out of a war and what do you expect you know they were all
1:23:57
kind of like excuses for me but I realized at one point there was something in me that was never affected
1:24:03
by the war that was not affected by any of the dramas and traumas that was not affected by anything that ever went on
1:24:09
and that took perfect care of me through all of that and while I was focused on
1:24:15
all the drama and trauma I was completely ignoring what was keeping me going at that point I thought
1:24:23
might be a bad idea to make friends with life and I'm not a war baby anymore
1:24:33
we've got about 9,000 I rewrote my whole life pages all just insights that come from
1:24:39
spending time with myself and going to the place where I've always been hope
1:24:45
like to apply it to you you know no matter what anybody ever said to you that has never or what you say to
1:24:53
yourself there has never ever been anything wrong with you even though you
1:25:00
felt bad yeah it's stupid thoughts you said nasty things and you acted badly
1:25:08
maybe hurt people all of that so how come how come there's never haven't been
1:25:15
anything wrong with you you're not what you feel you know what you think you know what you say you're not what you do
1:25:21
you are life and there has never been and will never be and can never be
1:25:27
anything wrong with life and when people go from that world of right and wrong
1:25:35
to connection with life surprise
1:25:40
surprise their behavior changes that's how we get out of the pickles that we've created
1:25:46
for ourselves over the past and 300,000 years it's time for a paradigm redo so
1:25:57
that's that's an overview of of that an overview of that whole topic literally
1:26:04
everything is a lot of stuff in it very condensed easy to read though and it's
1:26:10
only available on Amazon and Kindle because it's self-published okay yeah
1:26:17
there's the that's the other website that's we're only just putting that up
1:26:22
I'm going to create a platform I'm going to be talking about all of that for the next 30 years
1:26:35
hey God no okay all right that's it
1:26:51
okay and that's my last slide
1:26:56
[Applause]
