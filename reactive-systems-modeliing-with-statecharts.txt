Modeling Reactive Systems  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statecharts language, 
is especially effective for reactive systems [HP85, MP91]

Most realtime systems, for example, are reactive in nature. 

A typical reactive system exhibits the following distinctive 
characteristics:

• It continuously interacts with its environment, using 
- inputs and outputs that are either continuous in 
  time, or discrete. 
  The inputs and outputs are often asynchronous, meaning that they may arrive or 
  change values unpredictably at any point in time1.

• It must be able to respond to interrupts, i.e., high- priority events, even when it is busy doing 
  something else.

• Its operation and reaction to inputs often reflects 
  stringent time requirements.

• It has many possible scenarios of operation, 
  depending on the 
  - current mode of operation and the 
  - current values of its data, as well as its 
  - past behavior. (state change)


An Example: The Early Warning System
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the characteristics mentioned above are present in the 
simple early warning system (EWS) that we use as an example 
throughout this book to illustrate the ideas and features of the 
languages. 

The EWS monitors 
- input:   signal arriving from outside, 
- process: checks whether its value is in some predefined range, and if not 
- output:  notifies the operator by an alarm and appropriate messages. 

Here is a brief informal description of the EWS (Early Warning System). 
The EWS receives 
- input: 	a signal from an external sensor. When the sensor is connected, the EWS 
- process: 	processes the signal and checks if the resulting value is within a specified range. If 
  		the value of the processed signal is out of range, 
- output:	the system issues a warning message on the operator display and 
  		posts an alarm. If the operator does not respond to this 
 	 	warning within a given time interval, the system prints a 
  		fault message on a printing facility and stops monitoring 
  		the signal. The range limits are set by the operator. The 
  		system becomes ready to start monitoring the signal only 
  		after the range limits are set. The limits can be re-defined 
  		after an out-of-range situation has been detected, or after 
  		the operator has deliberately stopped the monitoring.
