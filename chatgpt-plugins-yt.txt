so months ago open AI released a painful version of chat gbt it's undergone tremendous scrutiny and in response what open AI has done is released a whole lot of plugins that are meant to just enhance your overall experience of chat gbt in this video we're going to take a look at 10 of the top plugins that we discovered these plugins are in no particular order and there are many more to choose from as you can see over here they are currently 960 plugins available and the number is growing by the day so there's a lot of Duds there's a lot that don't really work but there's some that have some really cool functionality and what we decided to do was explore a couple of them outside of the ones that you might have seen on YouTube so let's get stuck into that right now so the first thing you want to do is in your settings where your email password is you're going to see that there's general settings just underneath that you have the beta features now in the beta features you must make sure that your plugins are activated when you open up a new chat that is going to allow you at the top there to see this drop down menu now first thing you want to do is make sure that the plugins are enabled and then if you click on them the ones that you've installed will be available if you scroll all the way to the bottom you'll hit the plug install and all you need to do then is search for the particular plugin you're looking for and click on install and it will automatically install it for you now with that said let's head into our first plugin which is quick voice so quick voice is a voice generating AI software so let's give it a try and what we're going to do is ask it to create a 30 second narration advertising the benefits of sunshine I'd like to see what it creates if I just give it a prompt to see if it'll save me some time the point of these plugins is that they are meant to save you time and effort so that's what we really want to test okay so let's give a listen to what is created hey there are you feeling a bit down or low on energy well let me tell you about the magic of sunshine just a few minutes Under the Sun can boost your mood thanks to the release of Serotonin it's Nature's antidepressant plus Sunshine is a natural source of vitamin D essential for strong bones and a healthy immune system so why not step outside soak up some rays and feel the Sunshine work its Wonders on you trust me you won't regret it okay not bad and I like the fact that you can download it straight from the interface you don't even have to go and log in anywhere so that's quite functional voice could be more modular but overall not bad then canva the canva integration plugin I want to see how this thing works so let's go ahead and give it a try so I've asked for five social media posts that I can post to Instagram gives me a few options that I can choose from and as soon as I click on one that I like it takes me straight to my canva interface with the available social media template that I've seen here and I can spend a bit of time playing around with it and creating the content can we go back to chat GPT and ask it for a bit of content that I'm going to put up here and I need to do the work manually to to put it in so the plugin really will maybe just help you choose a particular template very quickly that you might like instead of going through canvas thousands of templates in the end it'll save a bit of time let's put it that way you'll save a bit of time by using this otherwise you can head straight to canva and use it there next one is the cap cut plug-in I really like this plugin because I can put in something as simple as you know correct me a 30 second tutorial on how to make a donut and in a matter of minutes cap cut is going to produce something that is really half decent have a look at this video that it's created welcome donut enthusiasts are you tired of donuts that taste like rubber tires fear not in just 30 seconds you'll become a donut making wizard step one grab your ingredients flour sugar and a dash of Love step two mix and like you're a DJ at a bakery rate step 3 roll that dough but don't play with it this isn't Play-Doh step four cut out circles the middle hole is optional but highly recommended for peekaboo fun step five fry until golden like a summer tan step 6 glaze or sugar cup it's your donut your rules and voila you've got a donut that even Homer Simpson would approve of happy munching you know what for the most part that was pretty good I went back into to the the plug-in and I asked it if it could generate some video footage instead unfortunately I couldn't do that however that's a pretty good use of time in terms of instead of having to go and create the script everything yourself the cap cut plugin is very useful the next one we're going to go and use is the hey gen plugin so you're going to activate your plugin and I'm going to ask it along the same lines I'm going to ask it to create a 30 second tutorial about a donut how to create a donut and sure hey gen does not disappoint in a few minutes it's created an AI Avatar that is going to be talking about my Donuts let's see what it's created over here hello lovely people ever crate to Donut at midnight worry not I've got you covered making donuts is as easy as pie pun intended first mix flour sugar and yeast need it like you've never needed before then let it rise until it's as fluffy as a cloud cut out those classic donut shapes and fry them up don't forget to glaze or sprinkle voila you've got yourself a donut worthy of a bakery or at least a late night snack cheers that is very cool that is something that I can actually use in conjunction with cap cut we've done a tutorial like this in one of our previous videos that you can have a look at although completely in chat gbt4 my goodness that's pretty cool our next plugin is going to be kids stories so if you're not a particularly creative person you want to write children's stories this plugin is going to help you do that what I liked about it is that it kept prompting me so I gave it rough parameters for a story and it asked me some very relevant questions like what I like how long would I like it to be what is the specific theme or lesson I'd like to convey in the story and by doing that I was able to enhance it so just in that sense it's a really cool way of getting a point to a story and almost having someone guide you through the story making process so pretty good I was pretty impressed with the result of that the next plugin was stories this is a story created but on steroids so what we're going to do is install it and then I've given it the story now it didn't exactly take my story in creating it what it did though was something completely unexpected and dare I say really good Zoe and the 10 second Heroes now the cool thing about it is you can go ahead and if you're happy with it you can claim the story by logging in you can go and publish it on Amazon you can edit it after you've signed in you can go and read the story foreign I just like to maintain a few more of the characters I use this plug-in a few months ago and since then it has improved tremendously and there's a lot more coherence and consistency in the characters so that's pretty good and you can go ahead and take the story publish it directly to Amazon and start making some money I think just double check that you're happy with everything but overall pretty good plugin then we have vizsler now visler is also a video creation tool so what we're going to do is ask it to create a captivating video about different dog breeds and it goes ahead and it creates something for us so let's have a look at what it's created [Music] [Applause] are you looking for the perfect dog breed for your family introducing the golden retriever known for their friendly and gentle nature next up the labrador retriever they are energetic and great with kids the Beagle is a small and friendly breed that loves being around children the Bulldog is known for its calm and patient temperaments making it a great choice for family [Music] boodle is highly intelligent and adaptable making it an excellent companion for kids the boxer is a playful and energetic breed that loves to be part of an active family choose the perfect dog breed for your family and create lifelong memories [Music] okay so in terms of the script the script was really good I like the fact that it has video visuals the only thing is it didn't create the consistency behind what it was saying it was talking about alsatians and all kinds of dogs and it didn't have that level of understanding yet to incorporate that specificity of image but that's okay overall it's created a video for me in under a couple of minutes and if it was a general video and I didn't have to go into much detail I think vizzler could create something half decent that I could use then we have Whimsical diagrams now Whimsical diagrams is a way of almost creating flowcharts and diagrams from simple prompts so we're going to go and ask it for something like something quite complex so create a diagram explaining the systems of how the body works and how they relate to each other so in a moment it's going to get to work and look at the results of what is created here that's actually pretty good I mean that is a decent study tool we've got all the systems exactly what they do and it's simply enough to understand so this is a great tool if you are studying and you want to make kind of a flow process of something very cool then we have Vox script so Vox script has internet capabilities and what I like about it is I went into YouTube and I I've got a video over here and I want Vox to give me the data for this video so in a matter of seconds it tells me about the video and then it asks if I want the video transcript what I'd once instead is a summary and the summary it creates is pretty extensive which is pretty cool and now I know whether or not I can actually go watch this video and we're going to end with speech key speech key is a voice generating AI Tech so if I ask it to create a motivational 30 second script for me of life lessons let's see what it creates first it asks me to choose a voice so it sends me over to the home page and I can choose from a whole lot of voices in different languages let's have a listen to them the term happiness is used in the the term happiness is the term once I've chosen one that I like I can just put that ID back into chat GPT and let's hear what it creates life is a journey filled with ups and downs twists and turns but remember the darkest hour has only 60 minutes you have the power to endure to overcome and to thrive don't let setbacks Define you let them refine you your struggles are your Stepping Stones to Greatness Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow and never ever give up you're stronger than you think and your potential is Limitless keep pushing forward and make every moment count so overall that's not bad I must say there were a couple of these plugins that we tested to make sure that they were functional and a lot of them either weren't working as people said they would or they just didn't do what they pertain to do that said in the coming weeks chatgpt is going to be releasing a whole lot more functionality so is it worth the twenty dollars that's up to you to decide thank you for watching this video all the links that you will need will be in the description below and as always if
