There are several ways to debug RxJS code:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the browser's DevTools: You can set breakpoints in your code and inspect 
the values of variables in real-time as your code executes.

Using console.log statements: You can use console.log statements in your code 
to see the values of observables at specific points in time.

Using the tap operator: You can use the tap operator in your code to perform actions 
such as logging the values of observables as they are emitted.

Using the RxJS Debug Operator: You can use the RxJS Debug operator to perform actions 
such as logging the values of observables as they are emitted, without modifying the source code.

Using a debugger like the Reactive Debugger extension: You can use a specialized debugger 
like the Reactive Debugger extension to debug RxJS code in a more comprehensive way.
