Like Button
--------------------------------------------------------------

- When the user clicks the “Like” button,
  which is indicated by the “thumbs up” icon,

- Then the “Number of Likes” counter will increment by a value of 1

- And the “thumbs up” icon will change from grey to blue
  as a visual indicator to the user that this has been selected.

Note how this statement describes the action and effect of clicking the Like button
but does not discuss how the coding for this button operation works.
