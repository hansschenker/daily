haskell types to typescript types
------------------------------------

map
--------------------------------------
(a: A) => B) => Array<A> => Array<B>

In this TypeScript type, A and B are placeholders for the types of the elements being mapped, 
and the type of the result respectively. 
The type represents a function that takes a function from A to B and a list of values of type A, 
and returns a list of values of type B.

filter
---------------------------------------
(a: A) => boolean) => Array<A> => Array<A>
In this TypeScript type, A is a placeholder for the type of the elements being filtered, 
and the type represents a function that takes a function from A to boolean and a list of values of type A, 
and returns a filtered list of values of type A. The function passed to filter is used to test each element 
of the input list, and elements for which the test returns true are included in the output list.

scan
----------------------------------------
type Fold<A, B> = (acc: B, x: A) => B;

(fold: Fold<A, B>) => Array<A> => Array<B>;
In this TypeScript type, A and B are placeholders for the types of the elements being accumulated and the type 
of the accumulated result respectively. The Fold type represents a binary function that takes an accumulator 
of type B and a value of type A, and returns a new accumulator of type B. The scan type represents a function 
that takes a Fold function and a list of values of type A, and returns a list of the intermediate accumulator 
values produced while reducing the list to a single value using the Fold function.

functional programming
------------------------------------------
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutability, 
and discourages the use of side effects and mutable state. In functional programming, functions are considered to 
be first-class citizens, meaning that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, 
and assigned to variables just like any other values.

Functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Lisp, and ML, are based on mathematical functions and therefore treat 
computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In functional programming, you write programs by defining and 
composing functions, rather than specifying a sequence of steps for the computer to follow. This leads to code that is 
more modular, composable, and easier to reason about and maintain.

Functional programming has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially with the rise of big data and 
concurrent systems, because it enables the creation of scalable and maintainable software that can handle complex, 
concurrent, and distributed computations.

functional programming with RxJs
---------------------------------
Yes, you can use functional programming techniques with RxJS, which is a library for reactive programming with JavaScript. 
RxJS is based on the observer pattern, which provides a way to observe and respond to changes in data over time. In RxJS, 
you can represent streams of events or data changes as Observables, and you can use a variety of operators to manipulate, 
filter, and transform these streams in a functional and reactive way.

For example, you can use the map operator to transform the values of an Observable stream in the same way as you would use 
the map function in a functional programming language. You can also use the filter operator to filter the values of a stream, 
the reduce operator to accumulate the values of a stream into a single value, and the combineLatest operator to combine 
multiple streams into a single stream.

By using functional programming techniques with RxJS, you can write reactive programs that are more readable, composable, 
and maintainable. This can help you create scalable and responsive applications that can handle large amounts of data and 
events in a clean and efficient way

Is RxJs Observable a Monad
-----------------------------
An Observable in RxJS is not a Monad in the traditional sense, but it can be seen as a generalization of a Monad. 
A Monad is a concept from functional programming that describes a structure for sequencing computations and propagating values 
in a composable way. In a sense, an Observable can be seen as a Monad because it allows you to sequence and 
transform computations over time in a composable way.

However, an Observable in RxJS is not a Monad in the strict mathematical sense because it does not obey all the laws of Monads. 
For example, the flatMap operator in RxJS, which is used to flatten a stream of streams, does not satisfy the associativity law 
for Monads. This means that the order in which the operations are performed may affect the outcome of the computation.

In general, the concept of a Monad can be useful for understanding the properties and behavior of Observables in RxJS, 
but it is not a perfect fit. It's better to think of Observables in RxJS as a unique and distinct concept that provides 
a way to represent and manipulate streams of values over time in a functional and reactive way.

In functional programming what is a Functor?
--------------------------------------------
In functional programming, a functor is a mathematical structure that represents a mapping between categories. 
A functor maps objects of one category to objects of another category, preserving the structure of the category in the process.

In the context of functional programming, a functor is often used to describe a type that implements a map function 
that takes a function from one type to another, and returns a new instance of the functor that has the function applied to its contents. 
The map function should satisfy the following two laws:

The functor's map function should preserve identity: map(id) is equivalent to id, where id is the identity function that returns its 
argument unchanged.

The functor's map function should preserve composition: map(f . g) is equivalent to map(f) . map(g), where f and g are any two functions.

Functors are used in functional programming to provide a common interface for mapping over structures, such as lists, arrays, 
trees, and so on. They provide a way to abstract over the specific implementation of a structure, and to write generic and 
composable functions that work with any functor.

For example, in Haskell, the Maybe type is often considered a functor, because it implements a map function that takes a 
function from one type to another and returns a Maybe value of the mapped type. Similarly, the List type is also often 
considered a functor, because it implements a map function that takes a function from one type to another and returns 
a list of the mapped type.

In functional programming what is a Monad?
--------------------------------------------
In functional programming, a Monad is a structure that represents computations as values, and provides a way to sequence 
those computations in a composable way. Monads provide a way to abstract over the implementation details of a computation, 
and to write generic and composable code that works with any Monad.

A Monad is defined as a type that implements two functions: bind (also called flatMap or chain) and return (also called pure). 
The bind function takes a computation, and returns a new computation that depends on the result of the first computation. 
The return function takes a value and returns a computation that produces that value.

The Monad laws specify the properties that a Monad must satisfy in order to be well-behaved. These laws ensure that Monads
 behave in a predictable and consistent way, and that they can be composed and used in a composable way. The Monad laws are as follows:

Left identity: return x >>= f is equivalent to f x

Right identity: m >>= return is equivalent to m

Associativity: (m >>= f) >>= g is equivalent to m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)

Monads are used in functional programming to represent computations that may contain effects, such as I/O, state, exceptions, 
and so on. By using Monads, you can write code that handles these effects in a predictable and composable way, and that separates 
the pure, side-effect-free logic from the impure, side-effect-full logic.

For example, the Maybe Monad is used to represent computations that may fail, and the List Monad is used to represent computations 
that may have multiple results. The IO Monad is used to represent computations that perform I/O, and the State Monad is used to 
represent computations that have state.

In functional programming what is a Applicative?
--------------------------------------------
In functional programming, an Applicative is a type class that extends the functor concept and provides a way to apply functions 
to values in a context, and to compose those applications in a way that is independent of the context.

An Applicative is defined as a type that implements a function ap (also called apply) and a function of (also called pure or return). 
The ap function takes a value with a function inside a context, and applies the function to a value inside the same context, returning 
the result inside the context. The of function takes a value and returns it inside the context.

Applicatives are useful for working with values inside a context, such as values that have optional, error-prone, or asynchronous behavior. 
By using Applicatives, you can write code that handles these values in a predictable and composable way, and that separates the pure, 
side-effect-free logic from the context-dependent logic.

The Applicative type class extends the Functor type class by adding the ap function, which allows you to apply a function inside a 
context to a value inside the same context. This allows you to perform multiple independent computations in parallel, and to combine 
the results in a way that is independent of the context.

For example, the Maybe type is often considered an Applicative, because it implements ap and of functions that allow you to apply 
functions to values inside a Maybe context, and to compose those applications in a way that is independent of the context. Similarly, 
the Array type is also often considered an Applicative, because it implements ap and of functions that allow you to apply functions 
to values inside an array context, and to compose those applications in a way that is independent of the context.
