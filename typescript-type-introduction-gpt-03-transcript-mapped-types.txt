an index map types are sort of the same
0:03
idea here where you can you can make a
0:06
function that creates a record type
0:10
where you pass in the names of the
0:11
properties you want and and
0:14
the value that you want to put in each
0:16
property and then we can strongly type
0:18
understand what comes out of it and you
0:21
can also write crazy things like
0:22
wrapping a proxy around an object and
0:26
have us understand how this all pans out
0:30
so here is for example a thing that
0:32
wraps a get and set proxy around every
0:35
property in an object type and now if I
0:38
give you a
0:39
an item here then I get back something
0:43
that has the same properties but each
0:47
property has been turned into a getter
0:49
or Setter of the same
0:51
type which is something that all also
0:53
happens a lot in JavaScript Frameworks
0:56
now
