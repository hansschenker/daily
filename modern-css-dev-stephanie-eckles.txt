Grid Techniques
---------------------------------

Default grid flow is oriented to "row" layout (1 Column - N Rows),
where items flow down the page along the Y-axis.

switch to "column" layout
-------------------------
grid-auto-flow: column;

This switches that default behavior to "column" 
which means items default to flowing along the X-axis.

this will add columns up to max width of container (grid has no explicit wrapping behavior)
grid wrapping with: grid-column-layout: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(60rem, 1fr)
---------------------------------------------------
items will take as much room as needed to contain their content up until the max width of the container, 
at which point text will break to new lines
there is a risk of overflow because of lack of "wrapping" behavior in grid, 
which means assigning this property will flow things along the X-axis into infinity
this can be solved by only applying this behavior above a certain viewport width via a media query

Note: once flexbox gap is fully supported, 
it will likely be the better method for this outcome due to also having wrapping behavior
