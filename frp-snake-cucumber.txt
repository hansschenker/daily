Player
-------
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, 

Snake, Board with walls, Food
----------------------------
which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), 
trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls" that surround the playing area. 

Snake eats food
----------------
Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, 
making the game increasingly difficult. 

Player controls snake direction
---------------------------------
The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), 
and the snake's body follows. 
The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress.

Snake
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane.

Player controls Direction of move
User keyboard input (left,right,up,down) changes direction of snake

Snake body
As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
 
Snake length
the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units 
away from the head. 

Player score
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
----------------

Rules
----------
- The snake starts at the center of the board, moving north (upward).
- The snake moves at a constant speed.
- The snake moves only north, south, east, or west (ignore the versions of the game where the snake can move in curves).
- The snake "moves" by adding a square to its head and simultaneously deleting a square from the tip of its tail.
- "Apples" appear at random locations, and persist for a random amount of time 
  (but usually long enough for it to be possible for the snake to get to the apple).
- There is always exactly one apple visible at any given time.
- When the snake "eats" (runs into) an apple, it gets longer.
.
- A snake dies by either (1) running into the edge of the board, or (2) by running into its own tail.
- The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake.
- The snake can be controlled by the arrow keys. 
  (You can use additional keysets if you like, but use at least these.) 
- There should also be a way to pause/resume the game (usually the "P" key).
