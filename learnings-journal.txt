functional typescript,          tomasz ducin, stackblitz.com/@hansschenker/typescript-tomas-ducin
				object composition (eric elliot book, object composition)
 				function composition (ramda, rxjs): pipe (left to right), compose (right to left)
functional programming,         creating little pieces (pure function), compose them in a pipeline (pipe is lazy: collection of expressions)
				it is like in mathematics: first you define formulas and formulas and at the end put them together and call them.
