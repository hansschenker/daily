Science of Osteopathic
---------------------------------------------------

Osteopathic medicine is a distinctive form of medical care founded on the philosophy that all body systems are interrelated 
and dependent upon one another for good health. This philosophy was developed in 
1874 by Andrew Taylor Still, MD, (pictured) who pioneered the concept of "wellness" and recognized 
the importance of treating illness within the context of the whole body. 

His research and clinical observations led him to believe that the musculoskeletal system played 
a vital role in health and disease. He concluded that the body contained 
all of the elements needed to maintain health, if properly stimulated.

He also promoted the idea of preventive medicine and endorsed the philosophy that physicians should focus 
on treating the whole patient, rather than just the disease.
