Here is a 3-month plan for running a sub-4 hour marathon:

Month 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gradually increase your weekly mileage to around 35 miles. (56km/woche) 10 +  20 + 30 = 60
 
- fartlek runs or tempo runs, into your routine once or twice a week.
- one long run every weekend, building up to a distance of 18 miles. (28km)
- proper nutrition, 
- hydration, and 
- rest.

Month 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue increasing your weekly mileage to 40-45 miles. (65km)
- one hill work into your training once a week to improve strength and endurance.
- speed work into your routine, such as track intervals or tempo runs.
- 20-22 mile long run on the weekend. (32km)

Month 3:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taper your mileage leading up to the race, reducing it to around 30-35 miles.
Do one or two short, high-intensity workouts, such as hill sprints or intervals, during the week.
Have your longest run be around 20 miles (32km)
two weeks before the race.
Eat a balanced diet, hydrate adequately, and get plenty of rest in the days leading up to the marathon.

- this plan is just a general guideline and you may need to make adjustments based on your 
  individual needs and abilities. It's also important to consult with a doctor and a coach 
before starting any training plan. Good luck!
