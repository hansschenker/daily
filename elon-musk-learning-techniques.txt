we all thought that Elon Musk was a businessman like Bill Gates but in reality musk is a scientist who has conquered the business world he is also the only inventor among the successful figures we know such as Warren Buffett likashing Jack Ma and Bill Gates they are Visionary businessmen who play with capital and rarely participate in the production teams of their companies but musk is not just the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla he is also the chief engineer of both companies he works over 12 hours a day spending 80 percent of his time on engineering and design rather than on marketing and social media musk has a passionate love for physics and he even named his youngest son in a unique way which is difficult to pronounce its correct pronunciation is x dash h12 where X represents an unknown variable and Ash is the ailf language he believes that learning and physics are the only hope to save humanity and he has placed this hope in his son now I will share with you how musk through his strong learning ability and thinking process went from being a coder to creating rockets that are more impressive than NASA's and is now being regarded as the closest to a God by many people first he emphasizes lifelong learning musk has two methods of lifelong learning the first one is reading a massive number of books he once said books were my teachers my parents raised me musk who was obsessed with reading can finish 60 books in a month he learns things very quickly often spending 10 hours a day on reading and even completing and digesting Knowledge from two different types of books in a single day his reading volume far exceeds that of his peers musk's brother Kimball musk recalled that since his teenage years Elon Musk would read two books from different disciplines every day this means that if an average person can finish reading a book in a month musk's reading speed is 60 times faster than that of an average person musk also often complain to Librarians about not purchasing enough books his favorite book is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which taught him that it is more difficult to ask the right questions than to answer them because once you can do that everything else becomes easier musk himself admits that maintaining a reading habit since childhood has given him the confidence for all his crazy ideas in an era when many entrepreneurs choose to drop out of school musk is the only one who did not drop out and holds bachelors in master's degrees in physics and economics the second learning method of musk is immersing himself in environments filled with talented people before creating Tesla did must know how to build electric cars no he didn't did must know how to manufacture Rockets before creating SpaceX no he didn't and not just him nobody in the world knew it except for NASA the books didn't mention this knowledge either so how did he do it in order to create SpaceX must move from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles he recruited NASA scientists as advisors for SpaceX I once watched an interview where they talked about how musk usually conducts interviews he would have technical discussions with experts from different departments working on Rockets an employee said that musk would keep asking questions until he understood 90 of what you knew by the time you realize that he was learning from you he had already learned it shaped him into an expert with knowledge Beyond most people's understanding he has always worked with the best people and every executive working at Tesla and SpaceX not only has expertise in a certain field but also understands the usage of each component and basic engineering knowledge this is also why musk started promoting the idea of Clubhouse because it allows us to immerse ourselves in conversations with entrepreneurs and experts in the most cost effective way and learn from them the third principle is the first principles thinking when musk was young he was afraid of the dark but he realized that darkness is just the absence of photons in the visible wavelength so he thought it was silly to be afraid of something without light this is how he explained Darkness to himself as a child using a scientific approach this shows his logical thinking of breaking down big problems into smaller ones that can be solved with physics it is the thinking from first principles that must highly advocates first principles thinking means looking at the world from a physics perspective peeling back the layers of appearances to see the essence underneath and then building up from the essence layer by layer however we often use comparative thinking to solve problems we tend to compare and imitate what others have done or are doing this approach only leads to small improvements and variations there is a classic example during Tesla's development when musk encountered the problem of expensive battery packs Insider said that the current battery packs were really expensive and the prices would not decrease in the future because they had always been that expensive under the influence of this thinking there was no room for improvement or cost reduction in the battery packs at that time the cost of battery packs was six hundred dollars per kilowatt hour however by starting from first principles musk studied and analyzed the battery packs and realized that they were made up of carbon nickel aluminum polymers for separation and a metal casing then he thought what if he purchased these raw materials from the London Metal Exchange and had his team assemble them into battery packs for electric cars to approach significantly reduced the cost of battery packs from six hundred dollars per kilowatt hour to eighty dollars per kilowatt hour this is what must cause the first principles thinking a thinking model that allows him to solve seemingly unsolvable problems and Achieve disruptive Innovations in fields like electric cars Aerospace clean energy and more the fourth principle is cross-disciplinary learning musk rejects the notion of specialized learning and instead advocates for cross-disciplinary learning in our traditional education we are taught that if we want to become top talents we must focus on one field however musk believes this is a mistake thinks that if he had only studied the automotive industry he would never have come up with ideas like solar energy or rocket launches cross-disciplinary learning provides us with the opportunity to connect various possibilities and ideas today musk's expertise spans across Fields such as Rockets Dynamics engineering biomimetics artificial intelligence and more he can be considered a polymath who applies this knowledge from Theory to practice during his high school years musk developed a strong interest in Rockets he studied rocket related Knowledge from textbooks later musk decided to build a rocket model by himself and even brought it to school for display it's worth noting that this rocket model could be ignited and launched musk's action caused quite a sensation at school and everyone regarded him as a scientific Prodigy in a television program the host asked musk if he could successfully launch rockets just by reading books musk replied affirmatively saying that in addition to reading one must also conduct numerous experiments the fifth ability is the capacity for transfer learning since childhood musk's reading range has encompassed science fiction philosophy religion programming as well as biographies of scientists engineers and entrepreneurs as he Grew Older his reading and professional interests expanded to include physics engineering product design business technology and energy this thirst for knowledge led him to explore various disciplines that may not be taught in school musk possesses a unique and often overlooked learning method the ability to transfer knowledge transfer learning involves applying what we have learned in one context to another context it could be taking the core knowledge acquired in school or from books and applying it to the real world it could also involve applying knowledge gained in one industry to another this is what sets musk apart and he has a unique two-step process to facilitate this transfer learning first musk structures knowledge into fundamental principles and mental models which aligns with the mentioned first principles Research indicates that transforming knowledge into deeper abstract mental models is beneficial for transfer learning there is a method that aids people in gaining intuitive understanding of potential mental models and it's called the method of comparison let's say you want to understand the letter a and the underlying principles that make it an a you can approach it in two ways method one by examining different variations of a and Method two by looking at a large number of identical as which method do you think would be better the answer is clearly method one each distinct variation of a and Method 1 allows us to delve deeper into understanding the similarities and differences between them whereas method 2 doesn't provide any insights when we learn something observing a wide range of different examples enables our intuition to identify the core elements and even create unique combinations in our daily lives this means that when we venture into a new field we shouldn't rely solely on one method where the so-called best practices we should explore various methods deconstruct each of them and then compare and contrast them this process helps us discover their fundamental principles next the Second Step involves musk reconstructing the fundamental principles of a new domain he takes the principles he has learned in artificial intelligence technology physics and engineering and reconstructs them into an independent domain which has contributed to building his massive and disruptive business Empire musk's achievements are not the result of magic it is simply the correct learning process at the deepest level what we can learn from musk's story is that we should not settle for specialization as the only or best path to Career Success and influence we can learn from musk's approach to learning and thinking which includes one reading a vast number of books two immersing oneself in environments filled with talented people three adopting first principles thinking and breaking down problems into smaller components four engaging in cross-disciplinary learning 5. developing transfer learning abilities musk is unique but his abilities are not miraculous although it is undeniable that he is a genius if he didn't have the persistence and belief in his own goals he wouldn't have achieved what he has today after his third failed rocket launch he was on the verge of bankruptcy a billionaire had fallen to the point of needing to borrow money from friends to get by therefore must becoming a legend is not accidental but inevitable don't forget
