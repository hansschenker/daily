Typescript higher order type relationship reasoning:  

T | never  is equivalent T
------------------------------------------
Yes, in TypeScript, the type T | never is indeed equivalent to T.
T is any type in TypeScript.
never is a special type in TypeScript that represents a type that should never occur.
In the context of type unions (T | never), never is effectively ignored because 
it cannot possibly occur. The union of any type T with never simply results in T itself. 

It's similar to the concept in set theory 
where the union of a set with an empty set results in the original set.

type T = string;
type Never = never;
type Union = T | Never;

let example: Union;

example = "hello"; // Works fine because 'T' is 'string'.
example = 123; // Error because 'number' is not assignable to 'string'.
Union effectively becomes string due to T | Never being equivalent to T.

T & never is equivalent never
--------------------------------
This is because never is a type that represents a value that never occurs. 
If one of the types is never, then the result of the intersection is never, 
regardless of what T is.
T is any type in TypeScript.
The intersection of any type T with never results in never itself. 

This is similar to the concept in set theory where 
the intersection of a set with an empty set results in an empty set.

Here's a quick TypeScript example to illustrate:


type T = string;
type Never = never;
type Intersection = T & Never;

let example: Intersection;

example = "hello"; // Error because 'string' is not assignable to 'never'.
example = 123; // Error because 'number' is not assignable to 'never'.
In this example, Intersection effectively becomes never due to T & Never being equivalent to never. 
No value can be assigned to a never type.

(A|B) & (C|D)  is equivalent A & C | A & D | B & C |B & D
----------------------------------------------------------- 
This is the distributive law of sets applied to TypeScript types.
A|B is a type that can be either A or B.
C|D is a type that can be either C or D.
(A|B) & (C|D) represents a type that is either A or B and either C or D at the same time.
This can be rewritten as A & C | A & D | B & C | B & D, 
A and C at the same time
A and D at the same time
B and C at the same time
B and D at the same time

This relationship holds due to distributive law in TypeScript's type system, and these 
two representations are equivalent.

Here is a TypeScript example to illustrate this:

typescript
Copy code
type A = { a: number };
type B = { b: number };
type C = { c: number };
type D = { d: number };

// This will allow objects that has a and c, or a and d, or b and c, or b and d
type CombinedType1 = (A | B) & (C | D);

// This is equivalent to CombinedType1
type CombinedType2 = A & C | A & D | B & C | B & D;
CombinedType1 and CombinedType2 would accept the same set of objects.

keyof (A & B) is equivalent keyof A | keyof B
-----------------------------------------------------

Yes, that's correct.

In TypeScript, keyof (A & B) is indeed equivalent to keyof A | keyof B.

Here's why:

keyof T is a type operator in TypeScript that produces a string or 
numeric literal union of its own keys.

A & B is an intersection type that includes all properties from both A and B.

keyof (A & B) therefore produces a union of the keys from both A and B.

On the other hand:

keyof A | keyof B produces a union of keyof A and keyof B, which are themselves unions 
of the keys of A and B, respectively.
Hence, both are equivalent. Here is a TypeScript example to illustrate this:

typescript
Copy code
type A = { a: number; common: string };
type B = { b: number; common: string };

// Keys: 'a' | 'common'
type KeysA = keyof A;

// Keys: 'b' | 'common'
type KeysB = keyof B;

// Keys: 'a' | 'common' | 'b' | 'common'
type IntersectionKeys = keyof (A & B);

// Keys: 'a' | 'common' | 'b' | 'common'
type UnionKeys = keyof A | keyof B;
In this example, IntersectionKeys and UnionKeys effectively become 'a' | 'common' | 'b', 
demonstrating the equivalence.

keyof (A | B) is equivalent keyof A & keyof B
------------------------------------------------
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct.

In TypeScript, keyof (A | B) is equivalent to keyof A & keyof B.

Here's why:

keyof T is a type operator in TypeScript that produces a string or 
numeric literal union of its own keys.

A | B is a union type that includes properties that exist in both A and B 
(properties that exist only in A or B are not guaranteed).

keyof (A | B) therefore produces a union of the keys from both A and B which 
are common to both A and B.

On the other hand:

keyof A & keyof B produces an intersection of keyof A and keyof B, which are 
themselves unions of the keys of A and B, respectively.
So in effect, keyof A & keyof B gives you the common keys between A and B, which aligns 
with the behavior of keyof (A | B).

Here is a TypeScript example to illustrate this:

typescript
Copy code
type A = { a: number; common: string };
type B = { b: number; common: string };

// Keys: 'a' | 'common'
type KeysA = keyof A;

// Keys: 'b' | 'common'
type KeysB = keyof B;

// Keys: 'common'
type UnionKeys = keyof (A | B);

// Keys: 'common'
type IntersectionKeys = keyof A & keyof B;
In this example, UnionKeys and IntersectionKeys effectively become 'common', 
demonstrating the equivalence.

S[X] <:T[Y] is equivalent S<:T or X:>Y
---------------------------------------------------
ChatGPT
Your statement seems to express a relation involving mapped or indexed types and type 
compatibility in TypeScript. However, it's not entirely clear what the symbols stand for.

In TypeScript:

S[X] generally indicates an indexed access type, where X is a property of S.
<: is a symbol often used to denote subtyping or type compatibility in type theory. 
A <: B means "A is a subtype of B", or "A can be used wherever B is expected".
S <: T would mean that type S is a subtype of type T, or that S can be used wherever T is expected.
If we take S[X] <: T[Y] to mean "S[X] is a subtype of T[Y]", then it implies that wherever
 you could use a T[Y], you could also use an S[X].

The statement S <: T or X :> Y seems to suggest either S is a subtype of T or Y is a subtype of X. 
The :> is not a common symbol in TypeScript or type theory, but if we assume it 
to mean the reverse of <: (i.e., A :> B means "A is a supertype of B"), then X :> Y 
would mean X is a supertype of Y or Y is a subtype of X.

However, these two statements (S[X] <: T[Y] and S <: T or X :> Y) are not necessarily equivalent. 
The first condition doesn't necessarily imply the second, and vice versa. For the second 
condition to be true, either S has to be a subtype of T or X has to be a supertype of Y. 
Neither condition implies that S[X] is a subtype of T[Y].

Also, in practice TypeScript doesn't have a syntax for directly expressing these subtype 
relationships in the way you're trying to. It's more about understanding the structural 
compatibility between types.

Please provide more specific details if this doesn't answer your question or if you meant 
something different with the symbols you used.

keyof A <: keyof B is equivalent B :> A
--------------------------------------------------

Your statement seems to indicate a relationship between the keys 
of two types A and B in TypeScript.

The symbol <: is often used to denote subtyping in type theory. 
If we read keyof A <: keyof B as "keyof A is a subtype of keyof B", 
then it suggests that the keys of A are a subset of the keys of B.

The symbol :> is not standard in TypeScript or in type theory, but if we assume 
that it's intended to mean the reverse of <: (supertype), 
then B :> A would read as "B is a supertype of A". 
This could suggest that B has all the properties of A (and potentially more).

However, these two statements are not necessarily equivalent, as it's possible 
that B is a supertype of A but still does not include all the keys of A as keys of B.

For instance, consider the following TypeScript code:

typescript
Copy code
type A = { a: number; common: string };
type B = { a: number; b: number; common: string };

// 'a' | 'common'
type keysA = keyof A;

// 'a' | 'b' | 'common'
type keysB = keyof B;
Here, B is a supertype of A, but keyof A is not a subtype of keyof B because keyof 
A includes key 'a' which does not exist in keyof B.

It's also important to note that TypeScript's type system is structurally typed, 
not nominally typed. This means TypeScript is more concerned with the shape of 
the type (i.e., the properties it has) than with the names of the types. 
It uses this structural typing to decide whether one type is assignable to another.

For B to be a supertype of A (meaning you can use a value of type B wherever 
a value of type A is expected), B must have at least all the properties that A has, 
with compatible types. This is true even if B has additional properties that A does not have. 
But this doesn't necessarily imply anything about the keys, as the relationship is about 
the properties and their types, not just the property names (keys).
