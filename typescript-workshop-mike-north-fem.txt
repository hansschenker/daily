Interfaces are for object shapes (object outline)
-------------------------------------------------
Interface to combine shapes of objects (animal and fish)
The shape is any 
- spatial attributes (especially as defined by outline) 
- outline of the object, 
- you can have multiple Interfaces with the same name (will be added to existing interface)

Types are for object construction (structure, object parts)
-----------------------------------------------------------
using Union or Intersection to construct new types
an Interface can extends other Interfaces and Class implements Interface
Interface work nice with Classes

the structure is the manner of 
- construction of the object and the 
- arrangement of its parts
