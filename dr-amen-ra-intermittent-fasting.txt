meet dr. noon s almond raw he only eats

one vegan meal a day that's right he'll

eats one hour a day

proving if you eat healthy you will not

lose muscle or lack energy he even set a

world record in dead lifting but his

goal is not bodybuilding or strength its

anti-aging longevity and the highest

quality of health and life we're not

telling people to eat only one meal a

day but we are here to show you what's

possible with intermittent fasting and

that we do not have to eat animal

products in order to thrive only a

handful of people on this planet have

the determination to live this way but

it's amazing what happens when we do

mankind is not supposed to have the

health problems it does and what we call

aging is not normal

let the wise words of this master teach

and lighten and inspire you hi thanks

for being here today it is my pleasure

so you only eat once a day that is so I

saw the video you're on the air every

you were a dead lifting champion that is

so I'm presently the world deadlift

champion drug-free world deadlift

champion in my particular class I hold

on several world national regional

Records cyclic fasting for instance is

known to potently promote growth hormone

release so throughout the duration of a

daily fast your growth hormone

concentration tends to increase if you

combine that with resistance exercise in

the evening as you probably know that

increases testosterone production when

you sleep that increases growth hormone

production IGF production so we're

talking about anabolic hormones that

essentially promote the preservation of

muscle tissue so a regimen which entails

daily cyclic fasting evening resistance

training all of these things combined to

enhance the preservation and also

augmentation of muscle tissue so you're

saying somebody's and s s and s to

actually gain muscle if it is regimented

if it combines these factors that is

increased growth hormone secretion as a

consequence of protracted fasting now

you notice that working out late in the

day is more beneficial than working out

earlier in the day what does it matter

it does matter and and that is because

essentially you want to enhance

autophagy throughout the day you want to

be catabolism

your proteins you want to be catabolism

stored sugar and stored body fat but in

the evening you actually want to

suppress autophagy in order to promote

that preservation of muscle tissue so it

is resistance training that stimulates

your skeletal muscle that provides those

metabolic factors that promote muscle

retention so yes evening it's best to do

resistance exercise this is actually a

good advice for even women they're older

postmenopausal women that who is working

out your muscles is part of what keeps

you young and do indeed you got to do

weight training even if you're an old

lady you got to work here otherwise your

bones go week everything starts falling

apart it's important what you're saying

is it helps keep you young this isn't a

vanity thing it's part what needs to

happen in your life indeed indeed and

sarcopenia that is age-related muscle

wasting muscle loss is a major of

catalyst for premature mortality

especially in women right they say that

the older you get the more you lose

muscle the more you lose your hormones

the more you start slowly basically

falling apart what you're saying is you

keep working out that doesn't

necessarily happen your case yes yes

that is quite so you can definitely

avert many of those changes and slow

down that process so you found that you

only have to sleep

as much as the average person yes that

was one of the first things that I

observed I was able to do without as

much sleep as I had previously and I was

able to recuperate from exertion far

more rapidly that I had been in the past

I was simply interested intellectually

in the pursuit of anti-aging studies

anti senescence studies and as I began

to discuss this with my then-girlfriend

approximately  years ago she said this

is interesting

caloric restriction cyclic fasting

specific nutriceuticals

a refined diet all of these things

clearly demonstrably scientifically

contribute to lifespan extension and I

explained how I was going to commence

collecting data writing a book and she

said she's not my wife by the way new

net Munro why don't we do it and it took

some time to reflect on that and I said

well why not and that was about a decade

and a half ago and through a few

evolutions if you will we've been on the

almond regimen for approximately 

years without fail it entails a daily

fast of  hours in duration caloric

restriction that is we consume

approximately , to , calories a

day it entails specific nutraceuticals

that is nutraceuticals that have been

found to increase maximum lifespan in

one or more organisms it entails daily

exercise it entails meditation

ascesis and basically that is the almond

regimen qualitatively the diet is devoid

of meat and centers on specific staples

if you will basically nuts grains tubers

dried fruit we always eat in the evening

we consume our evening meal our main

meal after our evening resistance

regimen our exercise is typically

organized in such a way that in the

morning we engage in so-called

persistence exercise what you might call

aerobics in the afternoon that's

typically another aerobic session time

permitting and in the evening is the

resistance exercise session and this can

entail a number of different standard

conventional weight lifting exercise

with integrated weighted yoga postures

in between sets and after this evening

resistance session is meditation or

final meditation session because

meditation is interspersed throughout

the day we meditate in two different

postures and one of those postures I can

demonstrate to you briefly

this posture is called

a rule AHA that is standing home and

this is the posture that I typically

assume in my brief of periods of

meditation say  to  minutes Aroo AHA

is a composite Egyptian term and it

means again standing form the ultimate

intent of all minimalist meditation is

to progressively produce a state of

sustained tranquility where ideas images

emotions are expedited from the mind

there are essentially  domains of

interventional studies what I call the

two tractus of anti-aging interventions

several of fundamental they include

caloric restriction cyclic fasting and

specific nutraceuticals

and a range of discrete genetic

modifications that alter specific

physiological phenomena in organisms

almost all of them will entail either an

increase in the optimization of

autophagy and that is simply a process

that enables the body to renew its

tissues glycation is an important

phenomenon glycation is that process

whereby circulating sugars bind to

protein lipids in the body and render

them resistant to renewal that

accelerates aging you also have fat

accumulation or adiposity that has been

found to increase the rate of Aging and

limit lifespan but more specifically

it's been found that the extra patient

of adipose the diminution of adiposity

increases maximum lifespan in mammals

and other organisms people you say

there's no way you can have that kind of

muscle and not eat for  hours a day

maybe it's I know the body's more

efficient but people are going to say

well doesn't your bodies are eating up

the muscle after a while actually

limited muscle catabolism is a good

thing

limited tissue catabolism is a good

thing and it might be illuminating to

conceive of it in this way the vast

majority of the solid component of your

body consists of proteins and each of

those proteins that constitute our

proteome so to speak have a definite

life span and the integrity in health of

your body is largely dictated by the

integrity of your individual proteins so

if you are able to prevent damage to the

corpus of proteins that constitute your

body or increase the rapidity with which

you renew and recycle proteins you are

functionally physiologically younger

there are a lot of people I'd say

because it used to be protein protein

protein what are you getting your

protein Gatti animals nowadays the big

thing is where you get your sugars like

the body needs to have sugar to run on

sugars the body's fuel if you don't put

sugar in your body carbs all day long

it's gonna you're gonna basically waste

away wait what do you think of that well

there's a fascinating body of research

which indicates that the process of

glycation is integral to aging and

glycation is that process whereby simple

sugars illicitly bind to the body's

proteins and render them resistant to

that process of renewal and this has

been found to greatly accelerate aging

that's one aspect of it the other aspect

is that when scientists have subjected

animals to a low glycotoxins ayat' that

is a diet that is low in so-called

advanced glycation in products this

independently increases lifespan so you

have a concomitant effect if you reduce

the endogenous generation of glycation

products and of course the best way to

do that is simply to reduce your

circulating sugar concentration to the

lowest extent practicable

and you avoid or reduce your

assimilation of exogenous advanced

glycation in products which are created

upon cooking and our extent in various

foods whether cooked or not you can

increase lifespan through this Avenue of

glycation restriction and this is one of

those interventions that are included in

the so called detractors of anti-aging

interventions that is glycation

diminution and this points to the

fundamental importance of cyclic fasting

as an avenue of lifespan prolongation

because it is cyclic fasting that most

potently suppresses the concentration of

circulating sugar the lower the

concentration of circulating sugar in

your body the less sugar you have to

attack your body's tissues and to render

them dysfunctional if you will where you

say you get your energy family if your

glucose levels and alone oh that's an

interesting question

most individuals have an appreciable

amount of energy stored in adipose and

this points to another element of the

detractors of anti-aging interventions

and it's that if animals are rendered

lean through either surgical expectation

of adipose tissue

targeted genetic interventions which

decrease adiposity that increases

lifespan independently so in a

convoluted way what I'm saying is that

when you don't consume exogenous sugar

you make use of that stored adipose and

that extra patient of adipose

independently promotes longevity

obviously you can get energy out of fat

but you don't have a lot of fat on you

so where do you get your energy from I

like your question because that points

to the third Avenue which is autophagy

when you deplete your glycogen largely

from your liver and your skeletal muscle

and again the morning aerobic exercise

stimulates that and you have a low

content of adipose tissue your body

makes use of stored proteins it Khattab

eliza's all of your body's proteinaceous

tissues and recycles them as substrates

for energy and that autophagy conduction

of energy metabolism if you will

contributes to lifespan prolongation by

renewing proteins more rapidly under

sustained caloric restriction or cyclic

fasting skeletal muscle is

preferentially preserved and there are

more labile proteins that are

catabolized before protein and before

brain tissue so these are selectively

preserved so ok let's talk about your

your diet so here you eat a lot of nuts

and visit roots start just things like

that yes grains grains really all this

within an hour yes or less skills we

have our tripartite meal if you will and

by tripartite I mean that the first

thing we consume when we break are 

plus hour fast is what I call the almond

amino elixir consisting of three protein

sources soy spirulina brewers yeast

and ideally a dozen isolated amino acids

and the next thing we consume is the

main meal one of those staples of which

I mentioned earlier these typically

include beans and rice um typically we

have one of three beings cannellini

beans is my favorite the red kidney

beans and when I say bean this is the

common bean phaseolus vulgaris and then

many different cultivars but one of the

main reasons that we select the bean as

an optimal staple if you will is because

there are many properties associated

with the common being that accord with

lifespan extension and these include

inhibiting the enzyme alpha-glucosidase

which promotes optimal glycemia if you

will these are called a fiber which

really helps that sugar levels and you

don't get rid of toxins it's great tindy

probably not the best cook foods you

have if you don't go with cookies is

great okay go I'm sorry wrong no no yes

roots tubers rice grain and nuts and

seeds fruit and fresh vegetation is not

high on our list of staples and that's

simply because the cellulose and the

water content take up space if you will

so if you have a regimen where you're

constricting restricting your feeding to

an hour or less and you consume foods

that occupy a large volume have a higher

water content indigestible fiber over

time that can reduce your sense of

satiation

so you want to have nutritionally dense

foods in order to essentially derive the

most nutrients in a minimal amount of

time right you wanna drink a Surrey and

then there is the minor meal and the

minor meal is nothing more than a

dessert

typically nuts dried fruit often what

you might call peanut butter and jelly

sandwiches or peanut butter and Nestle

bot sandwiches which roughly means royal

jelly that's one of the staples of our

minor meal and I say peanut butter and

jelly

with some reluctance because it differs

a bit from what you might find in a

typical grocery store it simply crudely

crushed peanuts and fruit preserves on

bread that's a typical dessert a typical

dessert may also be roasted peanuts with

dark chocolate I'm glad you said peanut

bars

I love Hannah butter and everybody says

peanuts our dad's got the toxins in it

after Lou Thompson toxin air that is why

roasted peanuts are actually

preferential in our ethos if you will um

because if you consume raw peanuts or

germinated or so peanuts it promotes

that growth of fungal organisms and

aflatoxins but um just to give an

indication of the scientific basis there

is an entire tract taped with several

sections that discuss multifarious

epidemiological and interventional

studies which find a relationship

between longevity and nut consumption

and peanuts are particularly prominent

in those studies that is it's been found

that consumption of peanuts of quartz

with lifespan the particular variety is

simply crushed um crunchy peanuts with

little added salt no other ingredients

pie is almost all he averaged over there

palm oil sugar

the sugar and all that that's why I'm

sometimes reluctant to call it peanut

butter because of the confusion that is

essentially the almond meal the

tripartite almond meal throughout the 

hour fast we typically consume teas in

herbal infusions of various sorts

these include green tea black tea oolong

tea but also two of the South African

teas honey bush and red tea or rooibos

hibiscus one of my favorites

rhubarb tea and any number of herbal

infusions most of which have been found

to influence one of these several

physiological factors that we know are

operative in the aging process and those

again include autophagy optimization

glycation inhibition fat oxidation

diminution of inflammation etc so when

you say nutriceuticals that sounds like

something from the pharmaceutical

industry you're talking about herbs and

natural things that's quite correct

there several of these one is niacin

bound chromium another is glucosamine

another is curcumin or turmeric another

is resveratrol and combined with cyclic

or intimate and fasting the polyphenols

that you find in green tea in

blueberries and in pomegranates so when

we speak of nutraceuticals

we're talking about these agents and

physiologically all of these

nutriceuticals have been found to

modulate one of several molecular

mechanisms and again we have our

familiar glycation autophagy induction

immune enhancement and lipid oxidation

or minimization and you take these

throughout the day as

stand with your teas and wired stuff yes

yes the tea's that we consume when they

are sweetened they're sweetened with non

calorific sweeteners such as stevia

which is essentially the sole sweetener

that I use during my fasting period so

your stomach yeah sorry not at all it's

a good sign

no this is actually a good comparison

here

you haven't eaten in a while your

stomachs growling he hasn't eaten since

yesterday and he's still fine my

accessory yeah well that sucks boy

excellent and actually that effect is

partly attributable to a peptide called

ghrelin and it is released by the

gastrointestinal tract in response to

food deprivation it actually increases

the expression of a peptide called BDNF

brain-derived nerve growth factor which

increases the proliferation of neurons

in the brain specifically in the

hippocampus an area that's associated

with learning and memory and that is

probably among the reasons that fasting

and caloric restriction increase mental

or cognitive acuity so this might

explain people in India there mainly are

vegetarians and they don't eat a lot but

yet they have some of the smartest

people in the world I can like literally

like calculate to the th decimal

point and these people that then say you

need me you need animal products you

need fat you need sugary all that stuff

tin to function properly

you got it dialed in to the point where

you're you're proving you need any help

products

I'm somewhat conventional and that I

promote the ingestion the use of

essential multi-mineral

multivitamin supplementation and

whenever someone subsists on a

calorically restricted diet either

quantitatively restricted or temporally

restricted it's important to ensure that

you get the minimal requisite amount of

essential nutrients right and that's

what I get from a standard vegetal

micronutrient micro minimal mineral

supplement I take that in powdered form

in the almond amino elixir and it's the

first thing that we consume on an empty

stomach and that's designed essentially

to be sufficient as a source of energy

and nutrients without the need for any

food at all so the elixir is intended to

deliver all essential nutrients in a

form that is easy to assimilate and the

meals are simply for satiety and

indulgence because I think that's an

important point to stress if you're

going to have a lifelong regimen that is

predicated upon lifespan prolongation it

has to be sufficiently palatable in

order to be sustained over a lifetime

and indulgence gratification is an

important element of enjoying life and

we do find that our diet is very

palatable very enjoyable even with the

perceived monotony we loved in it

feeding time is always festive it's

always a feast if you will what the

research indicates is that both cyclic

fasting and caloric restriction greatly

increased energetic efficiency such that

organisms can make do with less all of

their physical

cool systems become more efficient and

they're able to effectuate their

physiological operations with far less

energy and that reduced energetic demand

actually results in a lessened

generation of those deleterious

byproducts of metabolism free radicals

for instance advanced glycation in

products so with a reduction in

metabolism you get a concomitant

reduction in waste products and other

deleterious agents that damage the body

so the less waste products that your

body has to deal with the more clean

areas more efficient it is indeed being

clean is almost more important than

massive amounts of fuel just being

guzzle down indeed another effect that

has been observed widely on caloric

restriction cyclic fasting and other

interventions that increase lifespan is

a decrease detoxification capacity and

more specifically an Augmented

expression of so-called

Phase two enzymes or xenobiotic enzymes

and these are enzymes that are

specifically expressed in the liver also

kidney and other tissues that

essentially convert toxins in such a way

that enables them to be expiated from

the body more efficiently so this is

thought to be a major factor in the

lengthening of life's been associated

with fasting and caloric restriction so

the L of the organs that help eliminate

toxins from the body the liver the

kidneys if they're cleaner they can

focus more on producing enzymes and

keeping you running optimally rather

than just cleaning the house and getting

rid of unwanted garbage indeed and also

as we discussed together we are exposed

to multi Farias toxins that we can do

little as individual

to avoid in our modern environment so to

the extent to which we can augment our

detoxification capacity we can protect

ourselves from some of these toxins that

would otherwise be ubiquitous that are

ubiquitous and we simply can't avoid

right the toxins in the air the water

even the negative people it just drains

us our life works and dude so the

cleaner we are mentally physically and

emotionally the better we can thrive as

long living healthy beings indeed but I

must interject an element of my

philosophy and that is I wholly accept

the inevitability of Aging I wholly

accept the inevitability of death and my

regimen is simply predicated upon

postponing that process to the greatest

extent prime having a high quality of

life indeed which is much below the last

 years they're just falling apart

yeah explaining about the other people

yeah and it's important to have

sufficient energy mentally and

physically in order to arrive at the

psychological philosophical existential

state that you wish to attain before

that ultimate end you have a website you

want it I mean these I want to know more

advice blog where do I go you can go to

our website almond car elite athlete

calm and it has a description of my

overall regimen on the literature that

I've produced and how to acquire it I

don't sell my materials I release them

with a donation to individuals who are

earnestly interested and I stress that

because our order our regimen is ascetic

and it's clearly not for everyone so I'm

interested in individuals who

serious right there's a lot of people

can say this can be something that takes

I get bigger muscles are live longer or

not get sick right there is no quick

answer you have to this has to be a

lifestyle a way of living a being and

all-encompassing lifelong protocols

right right so folks this bought of this

this is not for most of you who want a

quick fix for something this is a

dedication to a life of way of living

Wilson yeah well thank you for your time

and you're quite an inspiration and

hopefully we'll check in again in a

while and any last words of advice for

people living the modern world we're

kind of like ready to throw their arms

in the air and say I how I I give up I

don't know what to do

subjecting yourself to self-imposed

discipline is the surest way to increase

the quality of your existence period

great thank you

you're quite well wow what a video huh

I'm gonna summarize the important parts

for you guys you weren't paying

attention because there's some really

important points to be made here first

of all we're not telling you guys to

only eat one meal a day this is an

extreme diet it's only for a few people

in the world who willing to dedicate

their lives to this but what we are

trying to do is show you a that you will

not waste away if you fast daily that

you know  eats one meal a day I'm

telling people to only fast for  hours

a day and eat for  hours so there's

really an you don't have the animal

products in order to have muscles notice

he also said sugar ages did he catch

that part he does aerobics several times

a day and he does weight-bearing

exercises at night aerobics cardio and

weight exercises are not the same thing

okay you got to move your body notice he

did a lot of standing during the day

standing versus sitting so we

intermittent fasting standing him versus

sitting and he when he eats his meal the

reason he has heavy things like beans

and rice and peanut butter

things like that is because he needs to

feel full he wants to enjoy his meal he

said that he gets his nutrition before

he has his meal from a plant-based

supplement kind of like my green formula

we have all your minerals and vitamins

and phytonutrients and he has some amino

acids just like my protein formula and

then he has his meal to feel full and

then he has his dessert to feel good so

he gets the pleasure out of meetings not

denying himself anything so it is he

very similar to could tell more Berg in

Norway that got the wheelchair guy who

healed himself and walked  kilometers

across Norway eating nothing but my

green formula and protein formula and

having some cashews and coconut oil to

feel full very similar to what mom and

rod is doing he has his nutritional

supplement and then he has his heavier

nuts and things which you can also get

some protein and substance from so this

is really inspiring notice he also said

no stress really important because you

will age and die if you have stress in

your life so do what you can get the

important bits of information from this

because this is gold this guy's taking

it to the extreme and to show you what's

possible you will not waste away if you

fast every day ok this guy's only

needing one meal a day we're not even

telling you to do that you can eat you

can have a bunch of meals during the day

but fast eat good things stay close to

nature

I hope this inspired you guys stay tuned
