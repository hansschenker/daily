Dopamine - this feels good. I want more.
---------------------------------------------------

Dopamine is the learning neurotransmitter.
It is the positive reinforcement neurotransmitter.
It is the transmitter that says, this feels good. I want more.





Serotonin - this feels good. I don't need anymore.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now serotonin is the opposite. It's the neurotransmitter that says,
this feels good. I don't want or need anymore.
Those are clearly two different things. And the problem is,

if you don't know the difference,
then you are basically subject to continuing to try to reward
yourself, ad nauseum.

Cortisol - produced when stressed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now there's a third component to this pathway that is absolutely essential.
And it's called cortisol. So cortisol is the stress horemone.

The prefrontal cortex is the part of your brain that keeps you from doing stupid things.

If you have a dysfunctional prefrontal cortex, you can't see the future. You only live for the moment.
Prefrontal cortical dysfunction is what turns a human into a lizard.

And so there's no ability to cognitively inhibit that feeling of
award, and that then drives the dopamine even faster.

And ultimately that's what needs to neuronal cell death.

Dopamin and Cortisol
----------------------------------------------------------------------
So as the combination of dopamine and cortisol,that leads to addiction.

So reward is good reward.Plus stress is not,

and that's what we all are now is chronically stressed.
And so chronic stress makes you want reward because of this lizard brain.
And so it sets you up for addiction.


Serotonin and Stress
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now on the other side, on the serotonin side,
chronic stress also in cortisol as an, uh, an effect as well.

So serotonin does bind to its receptor to inhibit the next neuron.
The problem is that the serotonin receptor is down-regulated by cortisol. 

So less serotonin, fewer receptors, that's depression.
So addiction and depression both occur.

Addiction - due to high dopamine,
Depression - due to lack of serotonin,

but in the presence of cortisol in the presence, chronic stress.

Dopamin - Ther Reward System is needed
-------------------------------------------

Now that rewards system is pretty darn important.
If you don't receive reward, you don't get out of bed.

You actually lie in bed and die is what happens.
And that's been done in transgenic animals.
They've basically knocked out the reward system and those animals have no will to live.
You need reward to be able to get up in the morning, go to work,
So reward is survival of the species.
You cannot do it without the reward. 

Reward vs Contentment - Pleasure vs Happiness
---------------------------------------------------------------

However,reward and contentment are not the same thing.

Reward and pleasure are synonymous.
Contentment and happiness are synonymous.

So people in our society have confused and
conflated these two concepts, pleasure and happiness.

So I find that there are seven differences between the two and
people need to understand these differences 

Pleasure short term - Happiness long term
----------------------------------------------------------------

one pleasure, a short term, like a meal.
Happiness is long-term like a lifetime to

Body
-----------------------------------------
pleasure is visceral. You feel it in your body.

Soul
--------------------------------------------------
Happiness is ethereal 
you feel it above the three pleasure is
taken like from a casino.

You get Pleasure is achieved from:
- alone. Like chocolate cake.
- substances cocaine , heroin,nicotine, alcohol, sugar,
- behaviors, shopping, gambling, social media,internet, gaming, pornography


Happiness is given like habitat for humanity. Number four,


Happiness is achieved in social groups like the birthday party.


happiness is not achievable with substances. Number six,


Pleasure is dopamine and happiness is serotonin.
So two different neuro-transmitters two different areas of the brain.
Two different regulatory pathways, two different mechanisms of action,
two different drivers. 

Dopamine is an excitatory, neurotransmitter,
and dopamine binds to its receptor. The next neuron gets excited, synaptic receptor activation.

Now neurons like to be excited, no, like to be tickled.
They don't like to be bludgeoned chronic overstimulation of any neuron
in the body leads to neuronal cell death.
And the reason is because neurons are so metabolically active and
neurotransmission is so metabolically taxing
that neuron is basically going to exhaust and die.
