js, javascript is a dynamic, weakly-typed, prototype based language with first-class functions 
ng2, Everything is a component 
js , only functions can create scope 
js, scope is the space where a variable can be seen and accessed 
js, scope is the lifetime of a variable, if a variable goes out of scope, its value can not be accessed except for closures 
js, there are only 2 scopes: the global scope and function scope 
js, every variable declared outside a function is in global scope 
js, every variable declared in a function is in local scope, available only inside that local scope 
js, in function scope, variables in the parent scope of the functions are visible and can be accessed 
js, a function created inside another function has accessed to the outer function scope and closes over these -
js, closures are used to create local state 
js, using "use strict" has the effect that if a variable is used before it was declared Js throws an error 
js, variable hoisting is the result of the 2 passes a js compiler does: in pass 1 all variables are allocated in memory, in pass 2 the code is run 
js, scope chain: scopes are nested inside scopes, every scope knows its parent scope 
js, scope chain - a variable is first looked up in the local scope, if it can't find it , it walks up the scope chain to the parent scope for a lookup 
js, function scope can be nested. A function created inside a function creates its own scope nested inside the outer function scope and has access to it 
js, scope chain is defined lexically, which means in the order in which the code is written 
js, 2 practices which use the fact the functions create scopes is 1 the practice of IIFE (Imediately Invoked Function Expression) and 2 creating Closures 
js, functional programming in Javascript depends on the fact of beeing able to create closures 
js, this is bound at call time 
js, when function is called as a method (object.methode) then this points to the calling object, function called as function points to window 
js, "use strict" will throw an error when accessing this points to window 
js, "use strict" helps to avoid this pointing to the global object by throwing an error when accessing with pointing to window 
js, fixing the problem with this, is to fix this within a function with a helper variable like self, self = this 
js, "use strict" , the default value of this is undefined not the window object 
js, call or apply , normally you would use call(fixed number of parameters) but when you have a variable number of arguments you use apply with the the array for any number of paramters 
js , all functions have the arguemts array, not really an array , you can mike to an array with Array.slice function 
js, bind fixes this at the time when we define a function, whereas .call and .apply bind this at call time 
js, .bind can only be used on function expressions not on function statements 
js, es6 arrow function is a function expression with .bind(this) called on, that fixes this to that expression 
js, functions are objects which are derived from Object 
ts, add --alwaysStrict compiler option to set on all files "use strict" 
js, prototype chain, every function has a prototype property which points to an prototype object. This prototype object has a constructur pointing back to the n 
js,pseudo-classical inheritance in 3 steps 
js, step 1: .call base class with this and the necessary parameters .call(this,fname,lastname) 
js, step 2: set the prototype of the base class to the inerited class: Employee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype) 
js, step 3: set constructor of inherited class back to its own constructor: Employee.constructor = Employess 
js,factory function is a fn which creates an object and returns it 
js, 3 ways to create an object with with properties: 
js, way 1: create an init fn on the object wich inits the properties: this.name = name (passed in from parameter) 
js, way 2: with Object.ceate(Prototype, Propertyname {"name": {value: "Hans"}}) 
js, way 3: with Factory Function: function PersonFactory(fn,ln) { var p = Object.create(Person); person.fn = passedParam; return p } 
js, programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. These behaviors js, could include extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system. Although similar behaviours js, can be emulated in nearly any language, with varying degrees of difficulty, complexity and performance costs, dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use js, of them. Many of these features were first implemented as native features in the Lisp programming language
Most dynamic languages are also dynamically typed, but not all are. Dynamic languages are frequently (but not always) referred to as "scripting languages", although the term "scripting language" in its narrowest sense refers to languages specific to a given run-time environment.
---------------------
JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
