An Angular Module is a unit of compilation
-------------------------------------------------------
template + components, directives and pipes in c
are used to create a Modulefactory.

At the core of Angular is a sophisticated compiler, 
which takes an NgModule type and produces an NgModuleFactory.

The component factory is a JavaScript class the framework 
can use to stamp out components.

JIT (runtime) and AOT (buildtime)
-----------------------------------------------------------
JIT
-------------------------
Angular 1 is a sophisticated HTML compiler that generates code at runtime. 
New versions of Angular have this option too: they can generate the code at runtime, 
or just in time (JIT). In this case the compilation happens while the application is being bootstrapped.
AOT
----------------------- 
But they also has another option: they can run the compiler as part of application’s build, or ahead of time (AOT).

Recap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The central part of Angular is its compiler.
The compilation can be done just in time (at runtime) and ahead of time (as a build step).
The AOT compilation creates smaller bundles, tree shakes dead code, makes your templates type-safe, 
and improves the bootstrap time of your application.
The AOT compilation requires certain metadata to be known statically, 
so the compilation can happen without actually executing the code.
