what is javascript reactivity

JavaScript reactivity refers to a programming paradigm 
- where a system automatically updates or responds to changes in data or state. 
  In the context of web development and JavaScript frameworks, 
  - reactivity is a core feature that allows for efficient and seamless updates to 
    the user interface (UI) when the underlying data or state changes.

Modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, React, and Svelte employ different approaches to 
achieve reactivity:

Vue.js: the reactive data model
---------------------------------
Vue.js uses a reactive data model built around an observer pattern. It tracks 
dependencies between data properties and UI components, and updates the UI whenever the 
data changes. Vue.js achieves this by using Object.defineProperty to 

- create getters and setters for data properties, and 
- watchers to track dependencies and trigger updates.

React: track changes in virtual DOM and update real DOM
--------------------------------------------------------
React uses a virtual DOM (VDOM) to track changes in the application state. 
When the state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then calculates the 
difference between the new virtual DOM and the current actual DOM. This process, 
known as 
- reconciliation or diffing, results in the minimum number of changes required 
  to update the actual DOM, leading to optimized performance.

Svelte: compile component into efficient Javascript
------------------------------------------------------------
Svelte takes a different approach to reactivity by shifting most of the work to 
compile time. It compiles the components into efficient JavaScript code that updates the 
DOM directly when the state changes. This approach eliminates the need for a virtual DOM 
or runtime reactivity system, resulting in smaller, faster applications.

In summary, JavaScript reactivity is a concept that allows web applications to efficiently 
and automatically update the UI in response to changes in data or state, and it's a key 
feature of modern JavaScript frameworks.

Javascript reactivity with javascript proxies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript Proxy objects are another way to implement reactivity in web applications.
 
Proxies were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a way to 
- create custom behavior for fundamental operations on objects, like 
  - getting or 
  - setting properties.

To create a reactive data object using JavaScript Proxies, you can create a handler object that 
defines 
- specific traps (functions) for operations like get and set. 
  These traps intercept the operations and allow you to execute custom logic before 
  or after the operation is performed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
function reactiveHandler(target, prop, value) {
  console.log(`Setting property "${prop}" to value "${value}"`);
  target[prop] = value;
  // Perform any other necessary updates, like re-rendering components
  return true;
}

const data = { message: 'Hello, world!' };

const reactiveData = new Proxy(data, {
  set: reactiveHandler
});

reactiveData.message = 'Hello, Proxy!';
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Logs: "Setting property "message" to value "Hello, Proxy!""

In this example, the reactiveHandler function is a trap for the "set" operation. 
- When a property is set on the reactiveData proxy, 
  the custom logic in reactiveHandler is executed.

Using JavaScript Proxies for reactivity can be a powerful technique, particularly for more 
fine-grained control over property access and modification. 

In fact, Vue.js 3 switched to using Proxies for its reactivity system, 
which improved performance and allowed for better handling of nested objects and arrays 
compared to its previous implementation with Object.defineProperty.

Javascript reactivity with Javascript Reactive Extensions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reactive programming is a paradigm that deals with asynchronous 
data streams and the propagation of change. The Reactive Extensions (Rx) library is an 
implementation of the reactive programming concepts, which provides a set of tools and 
utilities for working with asynchronous data streams in a more manageable and declarative way.

Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a specific implementation of the ReactiveX API for 
JavaScript. RxJS allows you to work with Observables, which are data streams that can emit 
multiple values over time, and can be manipulated, combined, and transformed using various 
operators. This makes it easier to manage complex asynchronous operations in your code.

RxJS can be used for implementing reactivity in JavaScript applications by treating changes 
in data or state as asynchronous data streams. You can 
- create Observables to emit new values when the data changes 
  and then use RxJS operators to react to these changes and 
  perform the necessary updates to the user interface or other parts of the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

// Create a BehaviorSubject to represent a reactive data stream
const dataStream = new BehaviorSubject('Hello, world!');

// Subscribe to the data stream to react to new values
dataStream.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(`New value: ${value}`);
  // Perform necessary updates, like updating the UI
});

// Update the data stream with a new value
dataStream.next('Hello, RxJS!');

// Logs: "New value: Hello, RxJS!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, a 
- BehaviorSubject is used to create a reactive data stream, and a 
- subscription is made to react to new values emitted by the stream. 
- When the data stream is updated with a new value using the next() method, 
  the subscribed function is executed.

RxJS can be a powerful tool for creating reactive applications and managing complex 
asynchronous operations. It can be used in conjunction with popular JavaScript frameworks 
like Angular, React, or Vue.js, or as a standalone library in your applications.

sample reactive Javascript application written in Model View Update Architecture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture is a pattern for organizing code in 
web applications, which clearly 

- separates the concerns of 
  - managing state, 
  - rendering UI, 
  - and handling updates. 

The key components of MVU architecture are:

Model: 
------------------------------------------
Represents the application's state


View: 
------------------------------------------
A function that takes the model and generates the UI (usually as a virtual DOM tree).

Update: 
------------------------------------------
A function that takes the current model and an action, then produces a new model 
based on the action.

Below is a simple example of a reactive JavaScript application using the MVU architecture. 
The application will feature a counter that can be incremented or decremented using buttons:

  <title>MVU Counter Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>

  <script>
    // Model State Object
---------------------
    const initialState = {
      count: 0,
    };

    // Actions: Action Definitions
----------------------
    const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
    const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

    // Update function - updates the State with an action, carrying the state change

    function update(model, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
          return { ...model, count: model.count + 1 };
        case DECREMENT:
          return { ...model, count: model.count - 1 };
        default:
          return model;
      }
    }

    // View - view dispatches the defined actions
----------------------------------
    function view(model, dispatch) {
      return `
        <div>
          <h1>Counter: ${model.count}</h1>
          <button onclick="dispatch({ type: '${INCREMENT}' })">Increment</button>
          <button onclick="dispatch({ type: '${DECREMENT}' })">Decrement</button>
        </div>
      `;
    }

    // Application - brings the 3 parts together
-------------------------------------------------

    function app(initModel, update, view, node) {
      let model = initModel;
      let currentView = view(initModel, dispatch);

      node.innerHTML = currentView;

      function dispatch(action) {
        model = update(model, action);
        const updatedView = view(model, dispatch);
        node.innerHTML = updatedView;
      }
    }

    // Mounting the application
-------------------------------------------------
    const rootNode = document.getElementById('app');
    app(initialState, update, view, rootNode);

  </script>
</body>
</html>

In this example, the MVU architecture is used to create a simple counter application. 
The update function takes the current model and an action, and returns a new model with 
the updated state. The view function takes the model and a dispatch function, and returns 
an HTML string representing the UI. The app function manages the state and the DOM updates.

When the buttons are clicked, the dispatch function is called with the corresponding action. 
The update function then calculates the new model, and the view function generates the updated UI. 
The app function takes care of updating the DOM with the new UI.

This is a basic example of how to create a reactive JavaScript application using the MVU 
architecture, which clearly separates state management, UI rendering, and updates.


Reactive Model View Update Architecture written with RxJs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can incorporate RxJS in the MVU architecture to handle actions and state updates 
in a more reactive way. In this example, I'll use RxJS to 

-create a reactive stream for actions and to 
- manage the state updates. Here's the modified version of the MVU counter

  <div id="app"></div>
  <script>
    // Model
    const initialState = {
      count: 0,
    };

    // Actions
    const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
    const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

    // Update
    function update(model, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
          return { ...model, count: model.count + 1 };
        case DECREMENT:
          return { ...model, count: model.count - 1 };
        default:
          return model;
      }
    }

    // View
    function view(model, dispatch) {
      return `
        <div>
          <h1>Counter: ${model.count}</h1>
          <button onclick="dispatch({ type: '${INCREMENT}' })">Increment</button>
          <button onclick="dispatch({ type: '${DECREMENT}' })">Decrement</button>
        </div>
      `;
    }

    // Application
    function app(initModel, update, view, node) {

      // action stream
      const actions$ = new rxjs.Subject();

      // state stream
      const model$ = new rxjs.BehaviorSubject(initModel);

      // scan actions and call the update function with state and action, start with initialState
      actions$
        .pipe(
          rxjs.scan((model, action) => update(model, action), initModel)
        )
        .subscribe(updatedModel => {
          model$.next(updatedModel);
        });

      // Update the UI when the model changes
      model$.subscribe(model => {
        node.innerHTML = view(model, action => actions$.next(action));
      });
    }

    // Mounting the application
    const rootNode = document.getElementById('app');
    app(initialState, update, view, rootNode);
  </script>
</body>
</html>

In this version of the counter example, we use an 

- RxJS Subject for handling actions 
- and a BehaviorSubject for managing the model's state. 

The actions$ stream receives actions dispatched by the view, 
and then the rxjs.scan operator is used to apply the update function and produce the new model. 
The new model is then emitted through the model$ stream.

The model$ stream is subscribed to, and the UI is updated whenever a new model is emitted. 

The view function now takes a dispatch function that pushes actions into the actions$ stream 
using actions$.next(action).
