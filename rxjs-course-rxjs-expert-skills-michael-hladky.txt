Suggestion for next course: RxJs Expert Skills:
---------------------------------------------------
- participants must know the basic concepts of RxJs
  (maybe the intro to basic concepts is not necessary)
  (you could give your slides to the basic concepts)

- start on an advanced Level
  Multicast Strategies, Error Strategies, 
  Custom Operator, Unsubscription Strategies,

- all Strategies with mostly exercise code

- a custom operator always addresses a use case
  it would help to describe first the use case and
  then look at the implementation

Suggestion: RxJs is now fully typed with Typescript
            Typescript Typing of RxJs could also be Expert Skills Block

Feedback: I very much appreciate your effort in this day
          very engaged and experienced presentation

Thank's a lot and see you tomorrow (hope micro works tomorrow)
