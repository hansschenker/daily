Patanjali describes the dynamics and power of the mind by selecting A precise term Chitta. Chitta is derived from the verb root Chitti. To comprehend, understand, realise or experience completely. Chitti Kitti sang gyane. The fact that the word for mind Chitta is derived from Chitti tells us the mind is both the means of and the conduit for understanding truth in its fullness. Through the mind, we become aware of reality within and without. The mind is a repository of all our thoughts, feelings, and memories. It's a storehouse of our likes and dislikes. We see the world and ourselves through the eye of our mind. When the mind is clear and peaceful, we see the world as bright and peaceful. When our mind is convoluted, our understanding of the world and our relationship with it becomes equally convoluted. Our concepts of good and bad, right and wrong, depend on the quality of our mind, as do our likes and dislikes. The quality of our mind in turn shapes our thoughts, speech and actions. Both the sage and the demon within us are the products of our mind. A luminous mind enables us to see and embrace the immortal omniscient being within. While a mind darkened by ignorance entangles us in the long chain of birth and death, with its incessant experiences of pleasure and pain. In other words, we shrink when the mind shrinks and expand when the mind expands. But in all circumstances, the minds inherent virtue, self-awareness remains intact. No force can rob the mind of its capacity to know and experience the reality within and without. Patanjali expresses this intrinsic ability by choosing Chitta over the many other words for mind in the Sanskrit language. The mind has the ability to comprehend the object of cognition, the process of cognition, and itself as the Cognizant force. Because it has the ability to know its own essence, its powers and privileges, it is known as buddhi, the force and conduit of illumination. Because the mind is aware of the object of thought, the process of thinking and itself as the agent of thought, it is known as Manus that which thinks. Because the mind has the ability to take on the qualities and characteristics of the object of its thought, it is known as ahamkara, the faculty of self identification. The minds most distinctive attribute, however, is its ability to know its own essence, its pure, pristine nature. The mind is intrinsically as pure and luminous as pure consciousness itself. See yoga sutra's, 354 and 355. Its discerning power is limitless. It can flow inward or outward. Despite this innate capacity to rule the objective world and to explore and master the vast universe within the mind suffers from lack of confidence in its own abilities. This is because in the course of our personal evolution, the mind has become heavily influenced by the subtle impressions of our past deeds and experiences. Those deeds and experiences are contaminated by likes and dislikes. They carry feelings of anger, hatred, jealousy, greed, love, lust, pity, compassion and cruel. Every deed and every experience contains traces of doubt, fear, regret and guilt. And these feelings accompany every segment of our memory. Memories pertaining to our deeds and experiences are deposited deep in our mind. These memories. Subtle mental impressions agitate our mind from deep within. Propelled by these impressions, the mind thinks and acts. Impressions and the thoughts and actions propelled by them are endless. That is why we find our mind constantly chasing one object after another. It has almost forgotten how to be still and be aware of its thoughts and actions. When awake, the mind is in the service of the senses, busily collecting pleasant sensory experiences and avoiding painful ones. During the Dreaming state, it buzzes itself with its own fabrications. When it is asleep, the mind casts a blanket of unawareness over its intelligence and busies itself holding on to that blanket. These incessant mental activities further reinforce the subtle impressions. Thus, the wheel of subtle impressions and mental operations gains an ever increasing momentum. And the mind becomes ever more deeply entangled. Patanjali calls these mental operations ruthies mental tendencies in motion. These roaming tendencies affect the mind in various ways. They can be disturbing, stupefying or distracting. They can make the mind 1 pointed and can lead it to a point where it is free of all thought constructs. In his commentary on Sutra 1, Vyasa identifies 5 distinct states of mind. Disturbed shifta, Stupified mood, her distracted, Vicks, Shifta 1 pointed E tagra and perfectly controlled Neruda. Each of these states causes the mind to function differently. The mind is disturbed because deep within the elements of attachment, desire, anger, fear and doubt are active and the mind is operating under their influence. The mind is stupified, dark, dense and dull. Because deep inside the elements of worry, grief, dejection, and hopelessness are active. And have rendered the mind inert. The mind is distracted because disturbance and stupefaction are mingled with enthusiasm, courage, motivation, clarity, and purposefulness. And all these elements are randomly active. As a result, the mind is partly focused and partly dissipated. A mind caught in any of these three states lacks clarity. It has no confidence in its own powers and privileges. It is indecisive and is only half heartedly willing to act on its thoughts and ideas. It seeks validation from external sources. When propelled by a disturbed, stupified or distracted mind, our endeavours, no matter how noble, bear little fruit. The fruit they do bear is invariably tainted by doubt, uncertainty and fear. It is a vicious circle. The actions and their fruits reinforce the subtle impressions that cause the mind to be disturbed, stupefied and distracted. As Vyasa states in his commentary on the first sutra, these dysfunctional operations must be arrested. This is where the quest for samadhi begins. With arresting the disturbed, Stupified and distracted mind, and by acquiring a mind that is 1 pointed ecogra and perfectly controlled Neruda. The mind becomes one pointed when the elements of purity, clarity, and peacefulness are active, deep within. Acting under the influence of these elements, the mind regains its power of illumination. Satva. It glimpses its own inner luminosity. As its attention focuses on its luminous nature, it regains confidence in its unique powers and privileges. A1 pointed mind is stable. It no longer grieves over the past, nor worries about the future. The elements of disturbance, stupefaction and distraction have been put to rest. The mind is serenely active and flowing peacefully inward. Now the practise of yoga in its truest sense has begun. As yoga practise deepens, the experience arising from it becomes increasingly refined and profound. As we will see in Sutras 142 through 150, this inward journey has four distinct stages, all of which are accomplished by A1 pointed mind. Finally, the mind acquires such a high degree of purity, clarity, and perfection that it is as brilliant as pure consciousness itself. See Yoga Sutra 355. In this state, all subtle impressions are reabsorbed into primordial nature, Prakriti, and we are absolutely free of the minds roaming tendencies. According to Patanjali, this state is yoga. When we attain this level of yogic realisation, what happens to our core being? That is the subject of the next sutra.

Sutra 3. 

Dada Drashtu Swarupe avastanam. 

Dada, then. 
Drastu, the seer 
Swarupa dwells in its own form (nature). 

Then the Seer becomes established in its essential nature. 
Our core being is consciousness, pure, eternal and unchanging. Consciousness is luminous and all pervading. 
Yoga philosophy calls it Purusha that which resides in the city of the body. The body is finite, but the consciousness residing in it is infinite, for it is unconfined by space. 

The body is mortal, but the consciousness pervading the body is immortal, for it is unconfined by time. Consciousness knows life and death for its intelligence is not dependent on the conduits of body, mind and senses for knowledge. 

It is the seer, the seeing power itself. It is the fundamental principle of pure awareness. Consciousness is an infinite and eternal field of intelligence, devoid of differentiation between subject and object. It is pure existence. Nothing, not even the sharpest mind, can fully comprehend this indivisible, self luminous intelligence. It is untouched by decay or decline and beyond want and need. It is perfect in every respect. This is the great and glorious truth of our core being. And yet from where we stand today in the journey of life, we are completely at the mercy of our mind. At this stage in our journey, the luminosity of our consciousness has become so subdued it is unable to comprehend its own essential nature. Consciousness itself, its capacities are so dormant it must seek help from the body, mind and senses for its own self realize. Its intelligence is so thickly veiled, it feels its presence only within the confines of the body, and that only vaguely. Its power of comprehension has become so limited it is unable to see it existed before birth and will continue to exist after death. It has fallen victim to the conditioning of time and space. Our core being, although all pervading, omniscient and beyond want and need can move only with the help of the body, can perceive only with the help of the senses and can cognize only with the help of the mind. The seer can no longer see itself. It has lost its capacity to experience its pure being directly and now depends on the mind to show it its reflection. Before it can perceive its true identity, it must see and recognize its own image, a process mediated by the mind. The validity of this recognition depends on how accurately the image is reflected in the mind and how accurately the mind presents that image to consciousness. In other words, consciousness, our core being can see only what the mind shows it. Practically speaking, it no longer has an independent existence. Consciousness is so intermingled with the mind that it knows and feels only what the mind knows and feels. The minds fear and doubt have become its own. The craving for pleasure and the aversion to pain now haunt our core, being as strongly as they haunt our mind. The question of when and how self luminous consciousness became intermingled with the mind and so strongly identified with it, has long captured the imagination of philosophers and thinkers. According to Patanjali, the cause is ignorance. Avidya. According to Vyasa, ignorance is our strong attachment to what is contrary to truth. The discussion of when, how and why ignorance, through its veil over consciousness, leads us nowhere when we are already deeply entangled. But it is important for us to understand that consciousness has fallen into the domain of the mind, and the mind has appropriated the role of consciousness. As a result, the mind is accompanied by the properties of both consciousness and the objective world. Although it is imbued with consciousness, it remains unaware of its conscious nature. The mind is assumed the form of its perception, yet behaves like the perceiver. Everything's object and subject, the perceived and the perceiver has become its object. C Yoga Sutra 423. This painful condition must be reversed. Consciousness must regain freedom from the slavery of the mind, and the mind must serve the purpose of consciousness. We can reverse this painful condition by purifying our mind and making it 1 pointed, clear and tranquil so it can begin to flow peacefully inward. Eventually we reach the point in our inward journey where the minds roaming tendencies subside and the subtle impressions. Lose their grip. There is no longer anything in the mind that can distort or contaminate the light of pure consciousness reflecting in it. As soon as consciousness sees its reflection and recognizes its true nature, the minde purpose is accomplished. The curiosity to know who I am, how I came to be here, and what will happen to me in the future, vanishes. See Vyasa on Sutra 425. The mind is no longer tossed by its wandering habits, figuratively speaking, the mind and our core being remain next to each other, but our core being is no longer touched by memories and mental cognitions, for there are none. This is what is meant by the SEER, becomes established in its essential nature. With the exception of those established in the highest state of samadhi, none of us know ourselves apart from our mind. The concept of pure being as opposed to impure being makes no sense to us. For most of us, the idea of a higher and a lower self has no real meaning. But we do know we have a mind. Experience tells us the mind enables us to succeed in both worldly and spiritual endeavors. As soon as we gain mastery over our mind, the door to all achievements swings open. A pristine mind is our best friend. It enables us to explore external and internal reality. However, when the mind becomes entangled in its own fluctuations, it is neither the time nor the energy to discover its own immense power. It no longer sees any reason to undertake the quest for inner fulfillment and ultimate freedom. It is so busy shifting among the disturbed, stupified and distracted states that it has neither the energy nor the wisdom to lift the veil of ignorance. The mind is essentially groping in darkness only when its roaming tendencies are arrested. Its field of memory is purified, and it regains its pristine nature. Can it recognize and communicate with the immortal self. Luminous, pure being. With this experience, the intuitive understanding of our core being dawns, and this is when the minds purpose is accomplished. What happens when we do not arrest the roaming tendencies of the mind is the subject of the next sutra.
