Angular KISS - Nir Kaufman, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc9V4lkLFeo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree you should use Angular in the simplest possible way! 
(do not use all the whistles and bells of Angular from the begin of your project)
Have a simple Angular Mental Model: Angular is 5D: 
- Directives 
- Data Binding 
- Dependency Injection 
- Decorators 
- Dirty Checking! 
or
Angular is a huge Template Engine: Angular starts with the Template 
(the my-component.html is not HTML it is a template with <ng-template> ... </ng-template>!
