Thank's for the advanced presentation on NgRx!

You mentioned in the video that you in your practice would create a feature module 'todos' and not put all your code in the app directory - you are a model for many developers and to my opinion you should even in just such a demo presentation create a feature module. People will copy the way you do it and for them putting all code in app directory is normal.

To me it feels wrong putting all code in the  app directory. The app directory should be reserved for app specific stuff!

Every feature the programmer wants to create goes into a  feature module, that's one of the strength of Angular that you organize  your code in features. (google like: Gmal feature, Drive feature, Foto feature...). It is no wonder that Angular is used inside Google so much, because it is a perfect fit for Google.
