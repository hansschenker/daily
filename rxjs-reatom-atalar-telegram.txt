Hi, thank you! Rx is overcomplecated under the hood and limited to FRP style... What you specially want to know?

artalar, [05.01.2023 11:19]
Oh and of course it has too little for automatic optimisations. For state management a glitches is a serious problem

question: a signal is a single value change tracking , a RxJs stream is values overtime with the possibilty of composing streams!

Hans, [05.01.2023 11:20]
in business problems you normally deal with more than one value tracking

Async data flow is about 1-3 parallel tasks, not much. In general.

But in state management there is a lot of DAG graphs from complex data agregation, I was seen it a lot of times in many different applications.

Btw, one thing is a greate about Rx is error and cancel interface - this is really needed sometimes

thank's a lot for the messages! Do you have a youtube presentation?     Have a great weekend!

I have one, but only on Russian. I plan to start do regular streams about Reatom in english after ~ half a year, currently beasy with the ecosystem
