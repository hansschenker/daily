-------------------
The essence of category theory is composition.

Algebraic Data Types is the composition of types

Product Type: Pair, Record, Tuple
Sum Type: Either, Option,

Category theory diagram is objects and arrows
Objects are the Types
An object in category theory is an abstract nebulous entity. 
All you can ever know about it is how it relates to other object


Arrows are the Morphisms (Functions)
Arrows compose (BM)

if you have an arrow from object 
---------------------------------------------------------
- A to object B, 
and 
- B to object C, 
then there must be an arrow — their composition 
— that goes from A to C
---------------------------------------------------------

function f that takes a A and returns a B: f A -> B
function g that takes a B and returns a C: f B -> C
function h that takes a A and returns a C: h A -> C, h: f(g)
You can compose them by passing the result of f to g

Properties of Composition
------------------------------
There are two extremely important properties that the composition in any category must satisfy.

1. Composition is associative.

To summarize: A category consists of objects and arrows (morphisms). 
Arrows can be composed, and the composition is associative. 
Every object has an identity arrow that serves as a unit under composition.

Higher order functions are what make symbolic manipulation of functions possible. 
They are the algebra of functions
