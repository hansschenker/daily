functional programming
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- it's all about the function composition 
- is the combination of reactive programming ideas and functional
- it could be named signal also it could be named observable or it could be named
- stream but idea is always the same that it's the value that changes in time observable is like a promise also that

- can execute multiple times okay now we also said that observable is also a

- function and Functor and functions are abstractions to do with functions in composition more efficiently efficiently
- and functor is actually the value with a context and we said that filter is something that can be mapped over so
  array is functor promises functor and observable is of course water and even
  the function itself is faster and also we said that there is something that's called 

- a monad and it is the functor with possibility to lift in in this context and also flatten
  from the context so that observable

- we can compose functions that have context so when it comes to observable 
  that context is of course the fact that the value is not available
