### Summary:
seven critical blood tests 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
that can significantly improve health by identifying potential health issues early. These tests are particularly crucial as illustrated by a case of a seemingly healthy man in his mid-50s who suffered a preventable heart attack. The tests include:

1. **Lipoprotein(a):**
   - Indicates risk for heart attacks.
   - Levels are primarily genetic and should ideally be below 30 mg/dL.
   - Recommended at least once in a lifetime.

2. **General Cholesterol Blood Panel:**
   - Includes total, HDL, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.
   - Essential for life but high levels, especially of LDL, can lead to cardiovascular diseases.
   - Lowering LDL levels reduces total death rates and heart attacks.

3. **HbA1c:**
   - Marker for diabetes, showing average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.
   - More reliable than insulin blood tests or continuous glucose monitors for non-diabetic patients.

4. **Sodium, Potassium, and Creatinine:**
   - Screen kidney function.

5. **Full Blood Count:**
   - Checks red and white blood cells, screening for conditions like anemia.

People aged between 18 and 35 should get these tests at least once, and those over 35 should get them every five years. Lipoprotein Little a needs to be tested only once in a lifetime unless abnormalities are noted.

The text also discusses the impracticality of conducting every possible medical test, even if cost is not a concern, due to the risks of false positives and negatives and the potential harm from some tests, like radiation from CT scans. It emphasizes the importance of pre-test probability and clinical judgment in deciding which tests to run.

Additional tests like liver function, thyroid function, high sensitivity CRP, and micronutrient tests are not routinely recommended for otherwise healthy people without symptoms, as per clinical guidelines for preventative care, but individuals may choose to get them based on personal preference and specific health conditions.

The text concludes by inviting comments on the discussed content and suggesting a follow-up video on diet based on current research.
