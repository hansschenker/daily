Observable is a Monad (chain,bind, flatMap) and a Functor (container with a value and map)
 - lazy ( you must subscribe)
 - pure
 - immutablee
 - infinite ( you must unsubscribe)

Observable is a function with context (Monad, Functor), takes input and gives output

Observable is a computation expression

Iterator Pattern + Observer Pattern
Producer, Consumer

Operators are Observable combinators (take Obs as input and return Obs as output)

Functional Reactive: Declarative all dependencies are declared at design time (like Excel Formula)

Reactive: Data variable with a time value , tuple of (value, time) - typically we say Event

Functional Reactive: is building a pipeline from a Producer (source stream) to a consumer (observer)

Observable connects a producer with a consumer
Hot Observable - producer is outside of Observable created
Cold Observable - typical producer inside Observable
