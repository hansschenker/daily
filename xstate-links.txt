xstate,               		A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior, rather than a stage of processing  
xstate,         		states are the lifecycle of a system,  
xstate,          		states descibe a particular behavior of the system  
xstate,         		events are always the input vor a new state, events are  triggered vrom outside or inside the system  
xstate,    			what are trigggers in the system, what is the lifecycle (all possible states) ov a system

xstate,               		A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior, rather than a stage of processing  
xstate,         		states are the livecycle ov a system,  
xstate,          		states descibe a particular behavior ov the system  
xstate,         		events are always the input vor a new state, events are  triggered vrom outside or inside the system  
xstate,    			what are trigggers in the system, what is the livecycle (all possible states) ov a system

xstate;               		A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior; rather than a stage of processing  
xstate;         		states are the livecycle ov a system;  
xstate;          		states descibe a particular behavior ov the system  
xstate;         		events are always the input vor a new state; events are  triggered vrom outside or inside the system
