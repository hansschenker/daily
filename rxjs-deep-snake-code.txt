create snake game with the help of chatgpt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given 	I have setup board of 30 by 30 cells 
      	and placed an initial snake with 3 cells in width in the middle of the board 
      	and also place a food with 1 cell width on a random cell on the board, 

When    the game starts, that is when the timer starts the snake moves in the initial Direction
        with an initial speed in milliseconds
When 	the user presses a key arrow 
        then the snake moves in the direction of the last arrow key
        the snake can not move in the opposite direction of the last pressed arrow key 

Then	I can move the snake in the direction of the last keypress 
        and check wheter the snake collides with the food, the board border or itself. 
        and when there is a collison with the food, 
          a new  food gets randomly placed 
          and the snake grows 1 cell longer,
          and the game score goes 1 point up 
        and when there is a collisona with itself 
          the player looses the game
          and the game is over

To create a snake game in Javascript using Rxjs, you will need to follow these steps:

Set up the game board: Create a 30 by 30 grid of cells using HTML and CSS.

Place the initial snake: Create a snake object with a width of 3 cells, and place it in the middle 
of the game board.

Place a food: Create a food object with a width of 1 cell, and place it on a random cell 
on the game board.

Start the game: When the timer starts, the snake should move in the initial direction with a 
given speed in milliseconds.

Handle arrow key presses: When the user presses an arrow key, update the direction of the snake 
accordingly. The snake should not be allowed to move in the opposite direction of the last 
arrow key pressed.

Move the snake: On each timer tick, move the snake in the current direction. Check whether 
the snake collides with the food, the board border, or itself.

Handle collisions: If the snake collides with the food, create a new food object at a random location, 
increase the length of the snake by one cell, and increase the game score by one. If the 
snake collides with itself or the board border, the player loses the game and the game is over.

To implement this game using Rxjs, you can create observables for each aspect of the game 
(such as arrow key presses, timer ticks, and collisions), and use operators to combine and 
transform these observables as needed. For example, you can use the fromEvent operator to 
create an observable for arrow key presses, and the interval operator to create an observable 
for timer ticks. You can then use combineLatest or other operators to combine these observables 
and update the game state accordingly.

const boardWidth = 30;
const boardHeight = 30;

const initialSnakeWidth = 3 // cells;
const initialSpeed = 500; // milliseconds
let direction = 'right'; // initial direction

// create a subject to emit arrow key presses
const arrowKeys$ = new BehaviorSubject<string>(direction);

// create an observable for timer ticks
const timer$ = interval(initialSpeed);

// create an observable for snake movements based on the current direction
const snake$ = timer(0, initialSpeed)
  .pipe(
    map(() => {
      const head = snake[snake.length - 1];
      let newHead;
      switch (direction) {
        case 'up':
          newHead = [head[0] - 1, head[1]];
          break;
        case 'down':
          newHead = [head[0] + 1, head[1]];
          break;
        case 'left':
          newHead = [head[0], head[1] - 1];
          break;
        case 'right':
          newHead = [head[0], head[1] + 1];
          break;
      }
      snake.push(newHead);
      if (snake.length > length) {
        snake.shift();
      }
      return snake;
    })
  );

// create an observable for food placement
const food$ = of(getRandomFood());

// create an observable for collisions
const collision$ = combineLatest(snake$, food$)
  .pipe(
    map(([snake, food]) => {
      const head = snake[snake.length - 1];
      // border collison
      if (head[0] < 0 || head[0] >= boardHeight || head[1] < 0 || head[1] >= boardWidth) {
        return 'border';
      }
      // self collison
      for (let i = 0; i < snake.length - 1; i++) {
        if (snake[i][0] === head[0] && snake[i][1] === head[1]) {
          return 'self';
        }
      }
      // food collision
      if (head[0] === food[0] && head[1] === food[1]) {
        return 'food';
      }
      return 'none';
    })
  );

// subscribe to arrow key presses and update the direction accordingly
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  if (event.code === 'ArrowUp' && direction !== 'down') {
    //direction = 'up';
    arrowKeys$.next('up');
  }
  if (event.code === 'ArrowDown' && direction !== 'up') {
    //direction = 'down';
    arrowKeys$.next('down');
  }
  if (event.code === 'ArrowLeft' && direction !== 'right') {
    //direction = 'left';
    arrowKeys$.next('left');
  }
  if (event.code === 'ArrowRight' && direction !== 'left') {
    //direction = 'right';
    arrowKeys$.next('right');
  }
});

// combine the observables and subscribe to update the game state
combineLatest(timer$, arrowKeys$, snake$, food$, collision$)
  .pipe(
    takeWhile(([timer, arrow, snake, food, collision]) => collision !== 'self' && collision !== 'border')
  )
  .subscribe(([timer, arrow, snake, food, collision]) => {
    if (collision === 'food') {
      length++;
      score++;
      food$ = of(getRandomFood());
    }
