Hi and welcome to this course.

My name is Hans Schennker and I will be your instructor in this course.

Now, this course is about Reactive Extensions for Javascript deep dive, 
so it is necessary that you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript.

RxJs is ...
  https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS
  .............................................

  The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a set of libraries for 

  - composing asynchronous and 
  - event-based programs using 
  - observable sequences and fluent 
  - query operators that many of you already know by Array#extras in JavaScript. (map, filter, reduce)


Now, in this course, we will dive deep in functional programming concepts
which build the basis of RxJs.

You will learn to apply RxJs programming style in your daily coding. 
You will see how streams of data are composed together with the help of RxJs Operators.
